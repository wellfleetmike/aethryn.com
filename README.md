## Project Overview
Aethryn is a community-built grid where technology heals, protects, and grows with the people who use it. This repo powers the public site [aethryn.com](https://aethryn.com), starting with a retro Netscape-inspired v0.1 landing page.

---

## The Aethryn Creed
1. Decentralize the Stack – Power belongs with people, not monopolies.
2. Govern in the Open – Every change is visible and accountable.
3. Protect Life – Heal, shield, and harmonize with human biology and nature.
4. Bridge Tech & Real Value – Prosperity for builders and users; no hidden toll booths.
5. The Calm Revolution – Better tools win by adoption, not by force.
