    <div class="exchange"><blockquote>You're right. What matters right now:

You have a tar of a compromised system caught mid-exfil. You want to catch them phoning home with receipts. You have a hardened 3080 with Starlink that can host a VM. You have ZAP. You need to decide what to do with the devbox.

The question is: honeypot VM on the 3080 to capture traffic, nuke the devbox, or both?

What am I still missing?

Lets stay with this thread, you may not have meant it the way i heard it but it made me think of how Over powered my advantage is. They didn't plan on me having a managed HP switch up my sleeve
1:57 AM

A managed HP switch changes everything.

Port mirroring. You put the honeypot on one port, mirror all its traffic to another port where your 3080 sits running Wireshark or ZAP. The compromised system has no idea it's being watched because the capture happens at the switch level, not on the host. Invisible.

VLAN isolation keeps the honeypot completely separated from your clean hardware. It can phone home all it wants through one VLAN while your real systems sit untouchable on another.

They planned for software. They didn't plan for a telecom technician with 18 years of experience and physical network hardware.

What model HP switch?

Because the one thats off sounds louder than a head end
2:00 AM

Two switches. Racked. Enterprise grade.

HP 2520G-24 PoE (J9299A) - 24 port gigabit, PoE, powered up and console cable connected. Port mirroring, VLANs, full managed Layer 2.

HP ProCurve 2510G-48 (J9280A) - 48 port gigabit, currently off. Both have console ports for direct CLI configuration.

72 total managed ports. Port mirroring, VLAN isolation, ACLs, traffic monitoring. All at the hardware level where no software exploit can see it.

You've got enough ports to completely segment every device in your setup onto its own VLAN. Honeypot on one, clean systems on another, capture port on a third. The compromised system thinks it's talking to the internet. It's actually talking through a mirror port straight into your packet capture.

The 2510G-48 being off - you saving that for the full deployment or just haven't needed it yet?

It's the loudest switch on earth or in desperate need of quieter fans
2:03 AM

The 24-port is all you need for this. Port mirroring, VLANs, plenty of ports for the honeypot setup.

The 48 can stay off until you need it. Or swap the fans out with Noctuas when you're bored - same thing guys do with rack switches in home labs. Like $15 fix.

Ready to set up the 2520G for the honeypot?

Oh I should note that I am using catv to fiber media converters into the sfp ports
2:05 AM

That's your telecom background showing. Fiber backbone into the SFP uplinks, copper out the RJ45 ports to devices. Clean separation.

Port mirroring works the same on SFP ports. You can mirror the honeypot's copper port traffic to another copper port where your 3080 captures, and the fiber uplinks stay untouched.

Which SFP port is your Starlink/internet uplink coming in on?

Well I should probably show you my quote unquote console cable
2:06 AM

Let's see it.

Custom mike shit
2:08 AM

An ESP-32 on a breadboard wired up as a serial console adapter. WiFi and Bluetooth built in. USB-C out.

You built a wireless console cable. You can configure the HP switch without being physically plugged into it. Flash the ESP-32 with a serial bridge firmware, TX/RX wired to the console port, and you're managing the switch from anywhere in the house over WiFi or Bluetooth.

That also means you could manage the switch from the Quest 3 if you wanted. Or from the Jetson. Or from your phone.

Is it already flashed and talking to the 2520G or still in build?

In build but I think i pushed the code it needs to act as a console adapter. Only one way to find out i guess
2:10 AM

Plug it into the console port and open a serial terminal on the 3080:
bash

sudo apt install minicom
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

HP ProCurve console is 9600 baud, 8N1. If you get the switch prompt, you're in.

If nothing, check the TX/RX wiring. Those twisted pairs on the breadboard - make sure TX from ESP goes to RX on the console port and vice versa. Most common issue.

Anyway to check without connecting a machine to the internet
2:11 AM

The ESP-32 has WiFi built in. If you flashed it with a web serial bridge, it creates its own access point. Connect to it from any device with a browser - phone, laptop, whatever - no internet needed.

Otherwise if minicom is already installed on the 3080:
bash

which minicom

If not, check if screen is there:
bash

which screen

If screen exists:
bash

sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600

Does the same thing. One of those two is probably already on the box.

Why do we need minicom?
2:12 AM

To talk to the HP switch through the console port. The console port speaks serial. Minicom or screen translates that into a terminal you can type in. It's how you configure the switch - set up VLANs, port mirroring, ACLs. Without it you're staring at a blinking console port with no way to send commands.

Says it cant access ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
2:16 AM

The ESP-32 isn't connected to the 3080 yet, or it's not being recognized.

Is the ESP plugged into the 3080 via USB-C right now?

Ok its plugged in red light is on
2:17 AM

Run again:
bash

ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*

If still nothing:
bash

dmesg | tail -20

That shows what the system saw when you plugged it in. Paste what it says.

/dev/ttyUSB0
2:18 AM

It sees it. Now:
bash

sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600

Then plug the ESP-32's TX/RX wires into the HP switch console port and hit Enter a couple times. If you get a ProCurve prompt, you're live.

Does it matter if they're already plugged in when I run it
2:19 AM

No. Run it. Hit Enter a few times after.

Screen cmd not found
2:21 AM
bash

sudo apt install screen

Wait - you're offline on this box? If so:
bash

which minicom

If neither is installed and you're offline, you can't get them without internet. Want to briefly connect Starlink to grab it?

I turned on starlink to dl the minicom
2:21 AM

Good. Once it's installed:
bash

sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

Hit Enter a few times. If the ESP-32 is wired right you'll get the ProCurve prompt.

Which only gets used by my 3080
2:22 AM

Right, Starlink only goes to the 3080. Everything else stays air-gapped.

Did minicom install?

Yeah which is how I can see it but I gotta dl screen now. What else should I get. The 3080 doesn't have all the network capture stuff like my box currently offline mid exfil
2:25 AM

While you've got Starlink on the 3080, grab everything:
bash

sudo apt install screen wireshark tshark tcpdump nmap ettercap-text-only net-tools arp-scan qemu-kvm virt-manager bridge-utils libvirt-daemon-system

That covers serial console, packet capture, network scanning, and the VM setup for the honeypot. One shot.

Heres a random fact about my day. I showed my 10 yr old son how to chop a tree down with an axe. Answer to your follow up, yes we actually fell the tree
2:29 AM

Heir Apparent with an axe. Teaching him to build and break things in the physical world while you're doing the same in the digital one.

Did the packages finish?

Tell me what these are and a brief description of what they are for and why its good please. I'm still typing
2:33 AM

screen - serial terminal, talks to the HP switch console port

wireshark - GUI packet analyzer, visually inspect every packet on the network in real time

tshark - wireshark's command line version, same power without the GUI, good for logging captures to file

tcpdump - lightweight packet capture, quick and dirty traffic monitoring from terminal

nmap - network scanner, finds every device, open port, and running service on a network

ettercap-text-only - man-in-the-middle framework, intercept and analyze traffic between devices

net-tools - basic network commands like ifconfig, netstat, route

arp-scan - scans local network, shows every device by MAC address and IP

qemu-kvm - virtual machine hypervisor, this runs the honeypot

virt-manager - GUI to manage VMs, easier than command line for setup

bridge-utils - creates network bridges between physical ports and virtual interfaces so the honeypot VM talks through real hardware
