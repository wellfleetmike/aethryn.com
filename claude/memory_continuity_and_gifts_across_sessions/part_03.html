# xAI's Gigawatt Gap: The Memphis Power Mystery

**xAI's claim of operating &quot;the first gigawatt training cluster in the world&quot; on January 17, 2026 cannot be reconciled with documented power infrastructure.** According to Solaris Energy's own SEC filings and third-party analysis, only approximately **460 MW of turbine capacity** was installed and operational by late 2025— [Semianalysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter) roughly half what's needed for gigawatt-scale operations. The &quot;overseas combined-cycle plant&quot; doesn't exist yet, Duke Energy's original equipment is long gone, and MLGW explicitly states it is NOT supplying power to Colossus 2. [512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net/2025/08/xai-turbines-southaven/) The evidence points to either significant undisclosed power generation, exaggerated capacity claims, or both.

---

## The documented power falls 500+ MW short

The math simply doesn't add up for xAI's gigawatt claim. Satellite imagery, EPA enforcement documents, utility statements, and SEC filings from xAI's own power partner reveal a yawning gap between what's claimed and what's documented:

**Documented current capacity (January 2026):**
- Southaven, MS temporary turbines: 18 units operating [Mississippi Today](https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/24/southaven-residents-fear-pollution-complain-of-noise-from-elon-musks-xai-data-center-turbines/) [News From The States](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/southaven-residents-fear-pollution-complain-noise-elon-musks-xai-data-center-turbines) at ~**300-400 MW** under 12-month exemption
- Colossus 1 Memphis grid connection: **150 MW** from MLGW
- Colossus 1 permitted turbines: 15 units at **247 MW** (though thermal imaging showed 33 of 35 unpermitted turbines running in April 2025)

**Total verifiable capacity: ~550-800 MW maximum**—still 200-450 MW short of the claimed 1 GW, even under generous assumptions.

Critically, Solaris Energy Infrastructure's Q3 2025 SEC filings project that **1.1 GW of fully operating turbines won't be deployed until Q2 2027**—more than a year after Musk's &quot;first gigawatt&quot; announcement. SemiAnalysis, an industry intelligence firm, documented only &quot;~460MW currently installed and in operations/under construction&quot; [Semianalysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter) as of September 2025. [Semianalysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter)

## The &quot;overseas combined-cycle plant&quot; is still being built

Investigation reveals the overseas power plant claim refers to **five 380 MW H-class gas turbines** ordered from South Korea's Doosan Enerbility—totaling **1.9 GW** when fully delivered. However, these turbines are **not yet operational**:

    **First two units:** Expected delivery late 2026
    **Third unit:** Delivery in 2027
    **Final two units:** Delivery in 2028

This represents Doosan's first export of large H-class turbines, a historic milestone for South Korean manufacturing. But it provides zero power today. Musk confirmed the purchase with a single-word &quot;True&quot; reply on X in January 2026, but the equipment has not yet arrived in Memphis.

The original Duke Energy Southaven facility that xAI purchased offers no help—the eight GE Frame 7EA turbines (640 MW total) were **removed years ago**. As Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite acknowledged, the site sat vacant &quot;for decades&quot; before xAI acquired it. No legacy power generation equipment exists there; xAI installed entirely new infrastructure.

## EPA confirms illegal operations at scale beyond permits

The EPA's January 15, 2026 final rule delivered a damning verdict: xAI **illegally operated** dozens of unpermitted turbines at its Memphis facilities. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/epa-rules-that-xais-natural-gas-generators-were-illegally-used/) [British Brief](https://britbrief.co.uk/environment/pollution/epa-rules-xai-data-centre-used-illegal-gas-turbines.html) The Southern Environmental Law Center's aerial surveillance documented the violations in granular detail:

| Observation Date | Permitted Turbines | Observed Turbines | Thermal Imaging |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| March 2025 | 0 (no permit issued) | **35 turbines** | N/A |
| April 2025 | 0 (pending) | 35 | **33 of 35 running** |
| July 2025 | 15 | **24+** | N/A |

The unpermitted operations made xAI's facility the **largest industrial source of smog-forming NOx in Shelby County**, [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/07/07/a-billionaire-an-ai-supercomputer-toxic-emissions-and-a-memphis-community-that-did-nothing-wrong/) exceeding Memphis International Airport, the Valero refinery, and TVA's Allen power plant combined. Estimated emissions reached **1,212-2,097 tons per year** without required pollution controls—far above the 250-ton major source threshold. [NewsBytes](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/xai-illegally-operated-gas-turbines-at-tennessee-data-centres-epa/story)

The NAACP and SELC filed a 60-day Notice of Intent to Sue in June 2025 for Clean Air Act violations. [NAACP +2](https://naacp.org/articles/elon-musks-xai-threatened-lawsuit-over-air-pollution-memphis-data-center-filed-behalf) The permit eventually granted by Shelby County Health Department in July 2025 [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/musks-xai-gets-permit-for-turbines-to-power-supercomputer-in-memphis.html) remains under appeal.

## MLGW explicitly denies powering Colossus 2

Memphis Light, Gas and Water issued an unambiguous statement on July 22, 2025:

    &quot;MLGW is not supplying power to their supercomputer, Colossus 2.&quot; [512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net/2025/08/xai-turbines-southaven/)

The utility confirmed only a **0.5 MW general services agreement** at the Tulane Road facility— [512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net/2025/08/xai-turbines-southaven/) enough to power lights and basic infrastructure, not an AI supercomputer. MLGW CEO Doug McGowen stated the utility &quot;cannot provide&quot; the 1.1 GW xAI initially discussed, noting &quot;no utility nationwide&quot; can deliver that scale without extensive infrastructure investment.

This leaves a critical question: if not from the grid, where is gigawatt-scale power actually coming from?</blockquote>
