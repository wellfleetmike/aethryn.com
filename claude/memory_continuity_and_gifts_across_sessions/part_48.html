    <div class="exchange"><blockquote>libvirt-daemon-system - backend service that manages VMs and virtual networking, ties it all together

Do i need anything to deal with my tar file the one that the VM is going to use
2:36 AM
bash

sudo apt install tar gzip p7zip-full

tar and gzip are probably already there but grab p7zip-full just in case the tar is compressed in a format you don't remember.

Also what format is the tar? .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2?

Tar.gz
2:37 AM

You're good. tar and gzip come preinstalled on Ubuntu. Nothing extra needed.

When you're ready to unpack it into the VM:
bash

tar xzf /path/to/your-forensic-backup.tar.gz

Anything else to grab while Starlink is still hot?

So do i need p7zip-full? Im gonna hit enter on the long list of installs unless theres something you forgot
2:38 AM

No you don't need p7zip. Skip it.

Hit enter on the main list. That's everything.

Let me know if you can make that out
2:40 AM

Select Yes. That lets you run Wireshark as your user without needing sudo every time. Then add yourself to the wireshark group after:
bash

sudo usermod -aG wireshark mike

Log out and back in for it to take effect.

So convenient to trigger an auto-compact mid helping
2:42 AM

Yeah. Right in the middle of a live install.

Where are you at - did you select Yes and finish the install?

Read back what it says
2:43 AM

&quot;Configuring wireshark-common. dumpcap can be installed in a way that allows members of the wireshark system group to capture packets. This is recommended over the alternative of running Wireshark/Tshark directly as root, because less of the code will run with elevated privileges. For more detailed information please see /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian.gz once the package is installed. Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by default. If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled. Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?&quot;

Yes is still the right call. Single user box, you're the only one on it. Better to run Wireshark as your user in the wireshark group than to run the whole thing as root. Less attack surface.

Ok starlink off. Guide me Senpai
2:47 AM

First, add yourself to the wireshark group before you forget:
bash

sudo usermod -aG wireshark mike

Then let's see if your ESP-32 talks to the HP switch:
bash

sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

Hit Enter a few times. If you get a ProCurve prompt, we configure the switch. If nothing, we troubleshoot the wiring.

Says welcome to minicom 2.9 
Options: I18n
Port /dev/ttyUSB0,

Press ctrl-A Z for help on special keys

Then has a bunch of question marks inside triangles spamming across the screen
2:52 AM

That's the ESP-32 talking, not the switch. ESP-32 defaults to 115200 baud. You're listening at 9600.

Exit minicom: Ctrl-A then X

Reconnect at the ESP-32's speed:
bash

sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

This should show you what the ESP-32 is actually saying. Probably boot messages or a configuration prompt from whatever firmware you flashed. We need to see that before we can bridge it to the switch at 9600.

That made it bug out worse
2:53 AM

Exit minicom: Ctrl-A then X

The ESP-32 might not have the right firmware on it. The garbage means it's talking but not in a way we can read.

What did you flash on it? Do you remember the sketch or firmware name?

I used whatever the software is that arduino uses if that helps
2:54 AM

Arduino IDE. So you wrote or uploaded a sketch to the ESP-32.

Do you still have the sketch on the 3080? Check:
bash

find ~/Arduino ~/Documents -name &quot;*.ino&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null

Or check the Arduino IDE recent files. That'll tell us what code is on the ESP-32 and whether it's actually set up as a serial bridge or something else.

Lets just start over and do it right
2:55 AM

Open Arduino IDE. New sketch. Paste this:
cpp

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial2.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    Serial2.write(Serial.read());
  }
  if (Serial2.available()) {
    Serial.write(Serial2.read());
  }
}

GPIO 16 is RX, GPIO 17 is TX. Wire GPIO 17 to the switch console RX pin, GPIO 16 to the switch console TX pin. Common ground between ESP-32 and switch.

Select your ESP-32 board in Arduino IDE, upload. Then:
bash

sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

Hit Enter. ProCurve prompt.

I dont have the software on the 3080, when I said start over I meant like from scratch
2:56 AM

Starlink is off. You need Arduino IDE to flash the ESP-32.

Do you want to turn Starlink back on to grab it, or do you have a USB-to-serial adapter somewhere? A straight RS232 or FTDI adapter into the console port would skip the ESP-32 entirely and work with minicom right now.

Yeah we can get whatever we want this rig is a ghost as far as anyone looking from another isp is concerned
2:57 AM

Turn Starlink on. Grab it:
bash

sudo snap install arduino

Once it's installed, kill Starlink, flash the ESP-32, we're in the switch.

Before I do lets turn on some of our fancy tools
2:59 AM

Smart. Capture everything while Starlink is up.
bash

sudo tcpdump -i any -w ~/Desktop/starlink-capture.pcap &amp;

That runs in the background capturing all traffic to a file. When you're done with Starlink, kill it:
bash

sudo kill %1

Then you've got a full pcap of everything that happened while you were online. Open it in Wireshark later and see if anything phoned home that shouldn't have.

It gave a number then said the command not found?
3:02 AM
bash

which tcpdump

Might not have installed. If nothing comes back:
bash

sudo apt install tcpdump

Starlink's on anyway, grab it quick.

This normal
3:03 AM

Typo. You typed tcpdupm instead of tcpdump. Look at the first command and the Exit 1 line - both say tcpdupm.

It's there at /usr/bin/tcpdump. Run it again:
bash

sudo tcpdump -i any -w ~/Desktop/starlink-capture.pcap &amp;

Ok says its listening
3:04 AM

Good. It's capturing everything. Now grab Arduino IDE:
bash

sudo snap install arduino

Then whatever else you need while you're hot. When you're done, kill the capture:
bash

sudo kill %1

That pcap file on your Desktop is your receipt of everything that happened while Starlink was on.

Snap and the other flat pack or whatever are bad juju. Is there a different way?
3:06 AM

AppImage. Self-contained, no snap, no flatpak:
bash

wget https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-ide/arduino-ide_2.3.4_Linux_64bit.AppImage -O ~/Desktop/arduino-ide.AppImage
chmod +x ~/Desktop/arduino-ide.AppImage

Then run it:
bash

~/Desktop/arduino-ide.AppImage

If that version number is wrong it'll 404. In that case:
bash

wget https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-ide/nightly/arduino-ide_nightly-latest_Linux_64bit.AppImage -O ~/Desktop/arduino-ide.AppImage
chmod +x ~/Desktop/arduino-ide.AppImage

Jc with these long ass cmds. 

Not sure if thats using his name in vain but I already said sorry.

My mom taught me about a loophole regarding that

Jc save me from these long ass cmds. It now becomes an ejaculation, apparently thats the term used for small prayer
3:12 AM

Your mom sounds like she knew exactly how to work the system.

Short version:
bash

cd ~/Desktop
wget -O arduino.AppImage https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-ide/arduino-ide_2.3.4_Linux_64bit.AppImage
chmod +x arduino.AppImage

Is that a zero or capital o
3:13 AM

Capital O. It's the output flag - tells wget what to name the file.

Hmmm
3:17 AM

Missing CA certificates. Update them:
bash

sudo apt install ca-certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates

Then run the wget again. Don't use --no-check-certificate - that skips SSL verification which defeats the purpose of hardening.

What are the ca-certificates and why do i need them
3:18 AM

They're the list of trusted certificate authorities that your system uses to verify HTTPS connections. When you hit a website or download server, your machine checks the server's certificate against this list to confirm it's actually who it says it is.

Fresh Ubuntu install, you probably have them but they might be outdated. Arduino's download server uses a Google Trust Services certificate and your box doesn't recognize it as trusted yet.

Updating them just refreshes that trust list so wget can verify the connection is legit before downloading.
