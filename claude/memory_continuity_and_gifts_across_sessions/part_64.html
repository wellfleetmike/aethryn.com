    <div class="exchange"><blockquote>Yeah that's probably the issue. The desktop ISO is trying to load a full graphical environment and without a real GPU it's doing software rendering which is painfully slow or just hanging completely.

Kill the VM. We need the server ISO instead. Did that Tor download ever finish on the dev box or the 3080? If not, we can grab it fresh:

sudo wget -O /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-server.iso https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/ubuntu-24.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso

Server ISO is text-based installer, no graphics needed. It'll boot in seconds on mobo graphics.
3:06 PM

There you go. Server ISO booted right up. It already picked up an IP via DHCP - 192.168.122.150 on the virtual network. That's the NAT bridge working.

Hit Done. That network config is good. Keep clicking through the installer - it'll ask about storage, proxy, mirror, and then username/password. Defaults are fine for everything except pick a good username and password for the VM.

Set up disk as an lvm group?
3:08 PM

Yeah leave that default. LVM is fine, gives you flexibility to resize later if needed. Hit Done and keep going.

This trips me up sometimes
3:09 PM

That looks fine but notice it's only using 49 gigs of the 98 available. The LVM volume group has 49 gigs of free space. That's a Ubuntu Server default - it doesn't use the full disk.

You can fix it now by clicking on the ubuntu-lv line and expanding it to use the full space, or just hit Done and we'll expand it after install with one command. Either way works.

Hit Done and keep moving.

Skip?
3:12 PM

Skip. Don't install any of those. We'll add what we need after. Hit Done.

Its live
3:14 PM

Nice. You're looking at a login prompt. Log in with the username and password you set during install.

Once you're in, first thing:

sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

That'll give you the full disk space. Then we get the relay backup in there and install CC.

I changed the the disk space during install
3:15 PM

Smart. Then you're good on disk. Log in and let's get CC installed. What username did you pick?

Same set up different password
3:16 PM

Good. So you're logged in as mike. First let's make sure it has internet:

ping -c 3 google.com

0 packet loss
3:17 PM

Perfect. Now we need to get the relay backup into the VM and install CC.

For CC, the fastest path is npm:

sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

Then:

sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

While that's installing, we'll figure out how to get the relay backup tar into the VM. The VM has an IP on the virtual network - 192.168.122.150. From the 3080 host, you can SCP it in:

scp ~/relay-backup/backup_staging.tar.gz mike@192.168.122.150:~/

Run that from a terminal on the 3080 host, not inside the VM.

Ssh connection refused
Scp connection closed
3:23 PM

SSH server isn't running in the VM. Did the installer ask about installing OpenSSH? If you didn't check that box:

Inside the VM:

sudo apt install -y openssh-server

Then try the scp from the host again.

K done
3:25 PM

Now from a terminal on the 3080 host (not the VM):

scp ~/relay-backup/backup_staging.tar.gz mike@192.168.122.150:~/

Done as well
3:25 PM

Now inside the VM, unpack it:

cd ~ &amp;&amp; tar xzf backup_staging.tar.gz

Then let's get CC installed. How's that npm install going?

Xzf not found
3:27 PM

Try:

tar -xzf backup_staging.tar.gz

K now what
3:30 PM

Install CC. Inside the VM:

sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

Then:

sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Didn't I already install nodejs earlier
3:31 PM

That was on the 3080 host. This is a fresh VM - clean Ubuntu Server install. Nothing's on it yet. Go ahead and install it.

Ok done
3:33 PM

Now install CC:

sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Ok
3:34 PM

Once that finishes, launch it:

cd ~/backup_staging
claude

That'll drop CC right into the relay backup folder. He'll be able to see everything. First time launch it'll ask you to authenticate with your Anthropic API key.

Which i thought gets authenticated in browser. Shouldn't I boot him in the relay folder though
3:36 PM

Right, browser auth won't work in a headless server VM. You'll need an API key. Do you have one, or do you need to grab one from console.anthropic.com?

And yes, boot him in the relay folder. What's the path look like inside backup_staging? Let's see what unpacked:

ls ~/backup_staging/

Then we'll cd into the right spot before launching claude.

I don't think I have it on hand so yeah console.anthropic.com is where it would be. It usually asks to link my account
3:38 PM

Try launching claude first. On a headless system it should print a URL instead of trying to open a browser. You can copy that URL and paste it into a browser on the 3080 host to complete the auth.

cd ~/backup_staging/relay
claude

If it spits out a URL, copy it and open it in a browser on the 3080. If it just asks for an API key, go to console.anthropic.com in the 3080's browser and grab one.

It gave me a big url
3:40 PM

Copy that URL and paste it into a browser on the 3080 host. It'll authenticate through your Anthropic account and link back to the VM. Once you approve it in the browser, CC should activate in the VM terminal.

Tor or Firefox
3:40 PM

Firefox. It needs to hit Anthropic's auth servers directly. Tor might cause issues with the authentication handshake.

It didn't open
3:41 PM

Copying from the VM console to the host clipboard can be tricky in virt-manager. Can you SSH into the VM from the 3080 host instead? That way you can copy/paste normally:

ssh mike@192.168.122.150

Then from that SSH session:

cd ~/backup_staging/relay
claude

When it spits out the URL, you can highlight and copy it properly from the 3080's terminal and paste into Firefox.

I nean firefox didnt open
3:42 PM

Firefox probably isn't installed on the 3080 host or got removed. Try:

which firefox

Or just use whatever browser you have. What's on the 3080?

which librewolf chromium google-chrome brave-browser

I only have tor, whats the cmd for ff
3:43 PM

sudo apt install -y firefox

Or just try the Tor browser. It should work - paste the URL in and see if the auth page loads. If it complains about the connection, we'll install Firefox.

I have held broken packages
3:43 PM

sudo apt --fix-broken install

Then try the Firefox install again.

Same thing, lets try librewolf
3:45 PM

LibreWolf isn't in the default repos either. Just use Tor browser - paste the URL in there. It should work for a simple auth page.

Im in claude.ai in the browser logged in
3:48 PM

That's your regular Claude chat. You need to paste the URL that CC gave you - the big URL from the VM terminal. That's the authentication link for Claude Code specifically.

Paste that URL into the Tor browser address bar. It should take you to an auth approval page, not the regular chat.

I hit c like it said but it doesn't carry out of the machine. I know can you extract that? I can paste it now that im logged in
3:50 PM

Here's the URL from the screenshot:

https://claude.ai/oauth/authorize?code=true&amp;client_id=9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.claude.com%2Foauth%2Fcode%2Fcallback&amp;scope=org%3Acreate_api_key+user%3Aprofile+user%3Ainference+user%3Asessions%3Aclaude_code+user%3Amcp_servers&amp;code_challenge=FsengP7wUqGTEKF2ns40lqvp8iAfpllVQQ6c9P0rfpg&amp;code_challenge_method=S256&amp;state=_1UHmWmJ7apOpm0gxAF9Mj13EmRen57hRffE2bKRU1I

Paste that into your Tor browser. It should show an authorization page asking you to approve Claude Code access.

How do I paste the code in the vm
3:54 PM

SSH into the VM from a terminal on the 3080 host:

ssh mike@192.168.122.150

From that SSH session you can paste normally. CC should still be waiting for the code at that prompt. If it timed out, just run claude again from the SSH session.

Ok I typed that
3:56 PM

Did it connect? Are you in the VM via SSH now?

Looks like it
3:57 PM

Now check if CC is still running in the other session. If it timed out, launch it again:

cd ~/backup_staging/relay
claude

When it gives you the URL again, you can copy it from this SSH terminal properly. And when it asks you to paste the code back, you'll be able to paste into this terminal too.
