    <div class="exchange"><blockquote>Good. So select &quot;ESP32 Dev Module&quot; and install that board package. Once it's installed we'll paste the serial bridge sketch and flash it.

Ok module is installing
5:59 AM

Let me know when it's done.

Ha! I just thought of something. What if I had CC cooperatively working together and orchestrating the network security detail. Options just got wild with that on the table
6:06 AM

That's not a bad thought at all. CC running on the 3080 with root access, talking to the HP switch through the ESP-32, monitoring the honeypot VM, capturing packets with tshark, running analysis - all from the command line where it's strongest.

You'd basically have an AI security operations center running on your own hardware. CC watches the traffic, flags anomalies, adjusts firewall rules on the switch, logs everything. You check in from the Quest 3 or your phone and ask what happened while you were sleeping.

But one thing at a time. Get this ESP-32 flashed first so you have console access to the switch. That's the foundation everything else sits on. CC can't manage a switch it can't talk to.

How's that install going?

True, sorry I got ahead of myself. It says esp32 dev board now
6:07 AM

Good. Now paste this into a new sketch. Clear whatever's in there and put this in:

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial2.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) Serial2.write(Serial.read());
  if (Serial2.available()) Serial.write(Serial2.read());
}

Then hit Upload. If it hangs on &quot;Connecting...&quot; hold the BOOT button on the board until it starts uploading.

Look ok?
6:13 AM

Code looks perfect. But the output panel shows it's still installing toolchain components - mkspiffs just finished and openocd is installing now. Let that finish before you hit Upload. Once the output stops scrolling and you see something like &quot;done&quot; or it goes quiet, then upload it. Remember, hold BOOT on the board if it gets stuck on &quot;Connecting...&quot;

It pulled an error when I hit verify
6:18 AM

What's the error say?

I think its a board issue maybe. Is mine in that mess
6:20 AM

Yeah, I see &quot;DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1&quot; in that list - that's the one for your WROOM-32 board. Change your board selection to that.

But the real problem is probably the ESP32 core version. You've got 3.3.5 installed, and in the 3.x series they stopped pre-defining Serial2. Update the code to this:

#include &lt;HardwareSerial.h&gt;
HardwareSerial Serial2(2);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial2.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) Serial2.write(Serial.read());
  if (Serial2.available()) Serial.write(Serial2.read());
}

Change the board first, paste that code, then try Verify again.
6:25 AM

Missing semicolon. Line 5, Serial.begin(9600) needs a semicolon at the end. Should be Serial.begin(9600);

Now I get
6:27 AM

That's a linker error - probably a duplicate symbol because Serial2 might already be defined in 3.3.5 and we're redefining it. Try going back to the simple version. Clear everything and paste just this:

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial2.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) Serial2.write(Serial.read());
  if (Serial2.available()) Serial.write(Serial2.read());
}

Make sure every line has its semicolons. If that gives an &quot;undeclared&quot; error, we'll rename it. But I think the linker was choking on the double definition.

Is that good
6:29 AM

That's a clean compile. 21% storage, 6% memory - plenty of room. Hit Upload now. Remember, if it stalls on &quot;Connecting...&quot; hold the BOOT button on the board until it starts flashing.

There are no buttons on this thing
6:29 AM

Try uploading anyway. A lot of ESP32 boards auto-enter flash mode through the USB chip without needing a button press. Hit Upload and see what happens.

Hmm
6:30 AM

Permissions issue. Open a terminal and run:

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

Then try Upload again. That gives the Arduino IDE read/write access to the serial port.

Failed? Reboot it?
6:33 AM

Disconnect the green and blue wires from GPIO 16 and 17 first. The error says &quot;removing any other hardware connected to IOs&quot; - those wires to the switch are interfering with the flash process. Unplug them, upload, then reconnect after it's done.

Its just hanging out like this
6:35 AM

That's done. 100%, hash verified, hard reset complete. It's not hanging, it's finished.

Now reconnect your green and blue wires to GPIO 16 and 17. Then open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE - it's the magnifying glass icon in the top right. Set the baud rate to 9600 at the bottom of the monitor window. Hit Enter a couple times and you should see the ProCurve login prompt.

Shit which one was where
6:36 AM

I don't have the specific color mapping from earlier, but here's what matters:

GPIO 16 is RX2 (receives data) - this connects to the switch's TX wire (pin 6 on the RJ45).

GPIO 17 is TX2 (transmits data) - this connects to the switch's RX wire (pin 3 on the RJ45).

If you don't remember which color was which, just pick one arrangement and try it. If you get it backwards nothing will break, you just won't see any data. Swap them and try again.

I think i got them plugged in right based of the pic I sent you
6:40 AM

Right, I can see from your earlier photo the wires were coming off the bottom pins. If you put them back the same way they were before you pulled them, you should be good.

Open the Serial Monitor now - magnifying glass icon, top right of Arduino IDE. Set baud to 9600 at the bottom dropdown. Hit Enter a couple times and see if the ProCurve responds.

No idea what im doing btw
6:42 AM

You're doing fine. That garbled text is just the ESP32 boot message - it always comes out garbled, that's normal.

Click in the message field at the top of the Serial Monitor where it says &quot;Message (Enter to send message to DOIT ESP32...)&quot; and just hit Enter a couple times. If the wires are right, the ProCurve should respond with a login prompt or command line.

If nothing comes back after a few Enters, swap your two wires and try again.

Does that help? Do you think the green and green white are crossed
6:45 AM

I can see the wires but can't read exactly which pins they're seated on from this angle. Here's what matters:

The green solid wire (pin 6 from the switch, switch RX) goes to TX2 on the ESP32. The green/white wire (pin 3 from the switch, switch TX) goes to RX2 on the ESP32.

If you're getting nothing back when you hit Enter in the Serial Monitor, swap them. It's the quickest way to know. Did you get any response at all when you hit Enter, or just silence after that initial garbled boot text?

My eyes are bad. From usb-c side 
B in pin 2 
GW in pin 6 
G in pin 7
6:49 AM

That's actually correct. Counting from the USB end on that row: pin 2 is GND (blue for ground reference), pin 6 is RX2/GPIO 16 (green/white receiving from the switch), pin 7 is TX2/GPIO 17 (green sending to the switch).

Wiring's good. Go hit Enter in the Serial Monitor a few times and see what comes back.

Nothing comes back
6:50 AM

Check the line ending dropdown at the bottom of the Serial Monitor. It's probably set to &quot;No line ending.&quot; Change it to &quot;Both NL &amp; CR&quot; and try Enter again. ProCurve needs the carriage return to respond.

?
6:53 AM

That's the terminal log, not the Serial Monitor. The Serial Monitor is the panel inside the Arduino IDE window itself - you should see a text input field at the top and output area below it. Click back into the Arduino IDE window and type there.

Also - is the switch powered on right now?

Yeah its on
6:53 AM

Go back to the Arduino IDE window - you should see the Serial Monitor tab with the message input field at the top. That's where you type, not the terminal.

But also - try swapping the green and green/white wires. Just switch which pin each one is on. Even though the mapping looks right on paper, the RJ45 end might be wired differently than expected. Quick swap, hit Enter again. That'll rule out crossed TX/RX.

What is it supposed to do? I'll try swapping even though you said it was correct, I did pull them out and they could be miss matched even though I doubt they are
