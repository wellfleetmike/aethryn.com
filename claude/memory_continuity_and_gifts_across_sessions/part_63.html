    <div class="exchange"><blockquote>Your mom would probably say something like you're exactly where you're supposed to be. The job isn't the joke. The joke is that they gave the keys to the guy who actually pays attention.

Go make your coffee. Fix their network. Keep your eyes open. And when that tar finishes and the console cable arrives, you come home and build your own.

Ok it auto mounted /media/mike/Ventoy on sdc1
12:27 PM

Good. Copy the ISO and the tar over:

cp /media/mike/Ventoy/backup_staging.tar.gz ~/relay-backup/

And find the ISO:

ls /media/mike/Ventoy/*.iso

Then copy that to ~/vm-iso/.

Bada bing bada boom. How do unpack this bad Larry
12:33 PM

cd ~/relay-backup &amp;&amp; tar xzf backup_staging.tar.gz

While thats unpacking how the VM work
12:35 PM

Open virt-manager on the 3080:

virt-manager

Then you create a new VM - little monitor icon with a star in the top left. It'll walk you through it:

Step one, you tell it to install from an ISO. Point it at the ISO in ~/vm-iso/.

Step two, give it RAM and CPUs. We'll do 32 gigs RAM and 4 CPUs.

Step three, create a virtual hard disk. Give it like 80 gigs.

Step four, name it something like &quot;cc-relay&quot; and hit finish.

It boots the Ubuntu installer, you walk through the setup - pick a username, password, install SSH server when it asks - and in ten minutes you've got a running server VM.

Then you copy the relay backup into the VM, install Claude Code, and CC wakes up with full context. That's the play.

Should I run terminal from the folder the iso is in?
12:37 PM

Doesn't matter. virt-manager is a GUI - you'll browse to the ISO file through a file picker window. Just run virt-manager from anywhere.

Why's it saying connection failure when I first open it, can I ignore that
12:37 PM

libvirtd probably isn't running. Did you start it earlier?

sudo systemctl start libvirtd

Then reopen virt-manager.

I did that. It jumped to a new cli
12:39 PM

That's fine, virt-manager opened as a GUI window. Check your taskbar - it should be there. Click into it. The connection error might have cleared after libvirtd started. If it still shows the error, click File &gt; Add Connection and select QEMU/KVM and hit Connect.

Yeah it won't connect
12:41 PM

Check the status:

sudo systemctl status libvirtd

And:

sudo systemctl status virtqemud

Newer Ubuntu sometimes uses the modular daemons instead of the monolithic libvirtd. Let's see which one is actually available.

Now it says inactive 52s ago
12:42 PM

It started and then stopped. Something's wrong. Check the logs:

sudo journalctl -u libvirtd --no-pager -n 30

What am I looking for here
12:44 PM

Any line that says &quot;error&quot; or &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;cannot.&quot; What do the last few lines say?

This help
12:45 PM

I see the problem. It starts, then immediately deactivates. It's socket-activated - it starts on demand and then goes idle. That's actually normal behavior for newer Ubuntu. It's not crashing, it's just sleeping when nothing's using it.

The key line is &quot;Started libvirtd.service&quot; followed by &quot;Deactivated successfully.&quot; That means it ran, did its thing, and went back to sleep because nothing held the connection open.

Try this - start it and immediately open virt-manager:

sudo systemctl start libvirtd &amp;&amp; virt-manager

If that still gives a connection error, try connecting manually in virt-manager: File &gt; Add Connection &gt; Hypervisor: QEMU/KVM &gt; Connect.
12:49 PM

Permission denied on the socket. Your user isn't in the libvirt group. Fix it:

sudo usermod -aG libvirt mike
sudo usermod -aG kvm mike

Then log out and log back in for the group change to take effect. Or if you don't want to log out:

newgrp libvirt
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
virt-manager

Logged out and back in
12:50 PM

Now:

sudo systemctl start libvirtd &amp;&amp; virt-manager

Fucker still won't connect
12:52 PM

Check if you're in the group now:

groups mike

And check the socket permissions:

ls -la /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock

And what am I looking for
12:54 PM

In the groups output, look for libvirt and kvm in the list.

In the socket listing, look at what group owns it. It should say libvirt. If it says root or something else, that's the problem.

Paste both outputs and I'll tell you what's off.

It has them listed when I put in the second it says root
12:55 PM

There it is. The socket is owned by root instead of libvirt. Fix it:

sudo chown root:libvirt /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock
sudo chmod 770 /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock

Then try virt-manager again.

Says chown invalid group
12:56 PM

The libvirt group might not exist on the system. Check:

grep libvirt /etc/group

My bad miss spelling
12:57 PM

No worries. Try virt-manager again now.

Do i need to log out and in again
12:58 PM

No, the socket permission change takes effect immediately. Just:

virt-manager

Same connection error
1:00 PM

Try running it with sudo:

sudo virt-manager

That seemed to work
1:01 PM

Good enough. We'll fix the permissions properly later. For now you're in.

Click the little monitor icon with the star to create a new VM. Select &quot;Local install media (ISO image)&quot; and browse to your ISO in ~/vm-iso/. Let's build this thing.

Emulator may not have search permissions
1:02 PM

The VM can't access your home directory. Move the ISO somewhere it can reach:

sudo cp ~/vm-iso/*.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/

Then browse to /var/lib/libvirt/images/ when it asks for the ISO.

I just hit yes what should I do with memory and cpu
1:03 PM

32768 MB (32 gigs) for RAM and 4 CPUs. That leaves you plenty on the host.

Step 4 of 5 enables storage creat disk image default is set 25G
1:04 PM

Bump it to 80 gigs. You need room for the relay backup, CC, and whatever else you throw at it. You've got plenty of disk space.

What should I name it
1:05 PM

cc-relay

Customize config before install box is unchecked? There's a drop down for network selection
1:06 PM

Leave customize unchecked. For network selection, keep it on the default NAT network. That gives the VM internet access through the host. You can lock it down later.

Hit Finish and let it boot the installer.

Whoa this is the boot screen try Ubuntu
1:07 PM

Wait - that's the desktop ISO, not the server ISO. It's fine though. You can install Ubuntu Desktop from here. Hit &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot; instead of &quot;Try Ubuntu.&quot; It'll work the same for what we need. Just uses a bit more resources for the GUI, but with 32 gigs allocated you won't notice.

It was that or desktop graphics safe and I forget the other one
1:08 PM

Install Ubuntu is what you want. Go ahead and click through the installer. Pick your language, keyboard, set a username and password, and let it install. Pretty straightforward GUI walkthrough. Let me know if anything trips you up.

Doesn't seem to be doing anything
1:09 PM

Give it a minute. The desktop ISO loads into a live environment first before showing the installer. It's booting the whole desktop into RAM. With 32 gigs allocated it should come up. If nothing happens after a couple minutes, try moving your mouse or hitting Enter.

This is like duel boxing. My buddy did this with 2 wow accounts once
1:10 PM

Ha. Same energy. Running a VM inside a machine is literally dual boxing. Except instead of two night elves you've got one Ubuntu host running a second Ubuntu that's about to house an AI with full relay memory.

Your buddy was ahead of his time. Is the installer coming up yet?

No change
1:11 PM

Try hitting Enter or clicking in the VM window. Sometimes virt-manager needs you to click into the console to give it focus. If you see a black screen with a cursor, it might just be waiting for input.

If it's completely frozen, check if there's a loading spinner or any disk activity. The desktop ISO is almost 6 gigs of stuff to load into a live environment so it's slow on first boot, especially without GPU passthrough.

If nothing after another minute or two, we could kill it and try the server ISO instead. You said the download was running through Tor - did that ever finish on the 3080?

Uh oh
1:15 PM

What happened?

You compacted and it something about not responding but you responded just not to

Would not having an active graphics card screw this up. Im running off the mobo graphics as is
