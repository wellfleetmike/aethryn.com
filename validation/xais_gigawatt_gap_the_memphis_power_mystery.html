<h1>xAI's Gigawatt Gap: The Memphis Power Mystery</h1>

<strong>xAI's claim of operating "the first gigawatt training cluster in the world" on January 17, 2026 cannot be reconciled with documented power infrastructure.</strong> According to Solaris Energy's own SEC filings and third-party analysis, only approximately <strong>460 MW of turbine capacity</strong> was installed and operational by late 2025—roughly half what's needed for gigawatt-scale operations. The "overseas combined-cycle plant" doesn't exist yet, Duke Energy's original equipment is long gone, and MLGW explicitly states it is NOT supplying power to Colossus 2. The evidence points to either significant undisclosed power generation, exaggerated capacity claims, or both.

<hr>

<h2>The documented power falls 500+ MW short</h2>

<p>The math simply doesn't add up for xAI's gigawatt claim. Satellite imagery, EPA enforcement documents, utility statements, and SEC filings from xAI's own power partner reveal a yawning gap between what's claimed and what's documented:</p>

<strong>Documented current capacity (January 2026):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Southaven, MS temporary turbines: 18 units operating at ~<strong>300-400 MW</strong> under 12-month exemption</li>
<li>Colossus 1 Memphis grid connection: <strong>150 MW</strong> from MLGW</li>
<li>Colossus 1 permitted turbines: 15 units at <strong>247 MW</strong> (though thermal imaging showed 33 of 35 unpermitted turbines running in April 2025)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Total verifiable capacity: ~550-800 MW maximum</strong>—still 200-450 MW short of the claimed 1 GW, even under generous assumptions.

<p>Critically, Solaris Energy Infrastructure's Q3 2025 SEC filings project that <strong>1.1 GW of fully operating turbines won't be deployed until Q2 2027</strong>—more than a year after Musk's "first gigawatt" announcement. SemiAnalysis, an industry intelligence firm, documented only "~460MW currently installed and in operations/under construction" as of September 2025.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The "overseas combined-cycle plant" is still being built</h2>

<p>Investigation reveals the overseas power plant claim refers to <strong>five 380 MW H-class gas turbines</strong> ordered from South Korea's Doosan Enerbility—totaling <strong>1.9 GW</strong> when fully delivered. However, these turbines are <strong>not yet operational</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First two units:</strong> Expected delivery late 2026</li>
<li><strong>Third unit:</strong> Delivery in 2027</li>
<li><strong>Final two units:</strong> Delivery in 2028</li>
</ul>

<p>This represents Doosan's first export of large H-class turbines, a historic milestone for South Korean manufacturing. But it provides zero power today. Musk confirmed the purchase with a single-word "True" reply on X in January 2026, but the equipment has not yet arrived in Memphis.</p>

<p>The original Duke Energy Southaven facility that xAI purchased offers no help—the eight GE Frame 7EA turbines (640 MW total) were <strong>removed years ago</strong>. As Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite acknowledged, the site sat vacant "for decades" before xAI acquired it. No legacy power generation equipment exists there; xAI installed entirely new infrastructure.</p>

<hr>

<h2>EPA confirms illegal operations at scale beyond permits</h2>

<p>The EPA's January 15, 2026 final rule delivered a damning verdict: xAI <strong>illegally operated</strong> dozens of unpermitted turbines at its Memphis facilities. The Southern Environmental Law Center's aerial surveillance documented the violations in granular detail:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Observation Date</th><th>Permitted Turbines</th><th>Observed Turbines</th><th>Thermal Imaging</th></tr>
<tr><td>March 2025</td><td>0 (no permit issued)</td><td><strong>35 turbines</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr>
<tr><td>April 2025</td><td>0 (pending)</td><td>35</td><td><strong>33 of 35 running</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>July 2025</td><td>15</td><td><strong>24+</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The unpermitted operations made xAI's facility the <strong>largest industrial source of smog-forming NOx in Shelby County</strong>, exceeding Memphis International Airport, the Valero refinery, and TVA's Allen power plant combined. Estimated emissions reached <strong>1,212-2,097 tons per year</strong> without required pollution controls—far above the 250-ton major source threshold.</p>

<p>The NAACP and SELC filed a 60-day Notice of Intent to Sue in June 2025 for Clean Air Act violations. The permit eventually granted by Shelby County Health Department in July 2025 remains under appeal.</p>

<hr>

<h2>MLGW explicitly denies powering Colossus 2</h2>

<p>Memphis Light, Gas and Water issued an unambiguous statement on July 22, 2025:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MLGW is not supplying power to their supercomputer, Colossus 2."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The utility confirmed only a <strong>0.5 MW general services agreement</strong> at the Tulane Road facility—enough to power lights and basic infrastructure, not an AI supercomputer. MLGW CEO Doug McGowen stated the utility "cannot provide" the 1.1 GW xAI initially discussed, noting "no utility nationwide" can deliver that scale without extensive infrastructure investment.</p>

<p>This leaves a critical question: if not from the grid, where is gigawatt-scale power actually coming from?</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Stateline joint venture and regulatory arbitrage strategy</h2>

<p>The evidence suggests xAI pursued a deliberate <strong>cross-border regulatory arbitrage</strong> strategy. After facing permit challenges in Tennessee, operations shifted across the Mississippi state line where different rules apply:</p>

<strong>Stateline Power LLC</strong> was formed April 28, 2025 as a joint venture:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> 50.1% Solaris Energy Infrastructure / 49.9% xAI (via MZX Tech LLC)</li>
<li><strong>Contract:</strong> Up to 900 MW of off-grid power for 7 years</li>
<li><strong>Financing:</strong> $550 million senior secured term loan from Stonebriar Commercial Finance</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> 2875 Stanton Road and 2979 Stateline Road, Southaven, MS</li>
</ul>

<p>Mississippi DEQ approved temporary turbine operations under Rule 2.13.D—a 12-month "temporary-mobile" exemption requiring <strong>no air permit and no emissions monitoring</strong>. As of January 2026, 18 turbines operate under this exemption while xAI's permit application for 41 additional turbines (targeting 1.2 GW) awaits review with a public hearing scheduled for February 17, 2026.</p>

<p>The Greater Memphis Chamber stated in May 2025 that xAI was "demobilizing turbines in Shelby County" with "no plans to site any turbines at its Tulane location"—technically accurate but misleading, as turbines were simultaneously being stockpiled across the state line.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Possible explanations for the power gap</h2>

<p>Several scenarios could explain how xAI operates at or near gigawatt scale despite documented infrastructure shortfalls:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Undisclosed turbine capacity:</strong> More equipment may be operating than publicly documented. Thermal imaging already caught 33 turbines running when only 15 were claimed operational.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Third-party power leasing:</strong> Solaris's Q2 2025 report mentions "short-term sourcing of third-party power generation capacity"—suggesting additional rental equipment beyond what's counted.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Phased operation:</strong> The "gigawatt" claim may represent peak design capacity rather than continuous operational power. Colossus 2 may operate at reduced capacity pending full turbine deployment.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Exaggerated claims:</strong> The "first gigawatt training cluster" announcement may be premature or aspirational, with actual operations below stated figures.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hidden grid connections:</strong> Undisclosed interconnection agreements with TVA or other utilities may provide supplementary power, though no documentation supports this.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Timeline discrepancies reveal aggressive narrative</h2>

<p>The disconnect between xAI's public claims and documented reality follows a consistent pattern:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Date</th><th>Claim</th><th>Documented Reality</th></tr>
<tr><td>July 2024</td><td>100,000 GPUs operational</td><td>Only 8 MW grid power + unpermitted turbines</td></tr>
<tr><td>April 2025</td><td>"Only 15 turbines operating"</td><td>33 of 35 turbines emitting heat</td></tr>
<tr><td>May 2025</td><td>"No turbines at Colossus 2 location"</td><td>Turbines moved to Mississippi instead</td></tr>
<tr><td>September 2025</td><td>Colossus 2 under construction</td><td>~460 MW total capacity deployed</td></tr>
<tr><td>January 17, 2026</td><td>"First Gigawatt training cluster"</td><td>Solaris projects 1.1 GW by Q2 2027</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Solaris partnership timeline—the only detailed public record of xAI's power infrastructure buildout—shows 1.1 GW capacity won't be fully operational until <strong>Q2 2027</strong>, eighteen months after Musk's "first gigawatt" announcement.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: Major discrepancy requires investigation</h2>

<p>The investigation confirms significant discrepancies between xAI's official narrative and documented infrastructure. The "overseas combined-cycle plant" is not operational and won't arrive until late 2026. Duke Energy's original equipment no longer exists. MLGW explicitly disclaims any role in powering Colossus 2. Documented turbine capacity at Southaven is approximately <strong>400-520 MW</strong>—roughly half of claimed gigawatt operations.</p>

<p>Either xAI has substantially more power generation capacity than appears in any public documentation, satellite imagery, or regulatory filings—or the "first gigawatt training cluster" claim significantly overstates current operational capacity. The company's history of operating unpermitted turbines, as confirmed by EPA enforcement action, suggests willingness to exceed documented limits. The power gap remains unexplained by available evidence.</p>

<p>What's clear: the publicly verifiable infrastructure cannot support gigawatt-scale operations as of January 2026. Where the additional 500+ MW is actually coming from—if it exists at all—remains the central unanswered question.</p>
