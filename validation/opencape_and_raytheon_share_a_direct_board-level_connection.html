<h1>OpenCape and Raytheon share a direct board-level connection</h1>

<p>A current OpenCape board member works as a Senior System Administrator at Raytheon Technologies, representing the most direct institutional link between Cape Cod's nonprofit telecommunications network and the major defense contractor. Beyond this personal overlap, <strong>OpenCape itself is a registered federal defense contractor</strong>, counts Joint Base Cape Cod as its first customer, and was founded by individuals with military and defense-connected backgrounds.</p>

<h2>The Raytheon connection: Jordan Keliinui bridges both organizations</h2>

<strong>Jordan Keliinui</strong> currently serves on OpenCape's Board of Directors while employed as a Senior System Administrator at Raytheon Technologies. According to OpenCape's official website, Keliinui—a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe—brings cybersecurity expertise to the board. This dual role represents the clearest institutional overlap between OpenCape and Raytheon identified in this investigation.

<p>No Raytheon board members or C-suite executives were found to serve on OpenCape's board, and no OpenCape executives were identified as holding positions at Raytheon. However, the Keliinui connection establishes that defense contractor personnel participate directly in OpenCape's governance.</p>

<h2>OpenCape's military and defense origins run deep</h2>

<p>OpenCape Corporation emerged from a 2006 meeting convened by <strong>Dan Gallagher</strong>, a retired U.S. Navy officer who was then Executive Director of IT at Cape Cod Community College. Gallagher served as OpenCape's first CEO and later as Senior Consultant. Co-founder <strong>Art Gaylord</strong>, who remains Chairman Emeritus, previously managed the fiber optic network serving "six major private and federal government organizations" in the Woods Hole area while directing IT at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>

<p>Current board member <strong>Sean Kukauskas</strong>, Executive Director of Mass General Brigham Ambulance Services, is also a Navy veteran. The board's defense and military connections thus extend beyond the Raytheon tie to include founding leadership with naval backgrounds.</p>

<p>OpenCape's official website explicitly states the organization is a "<strong>registered federal vendor and defense contractor</strong>"—making it not merely a civilian broadband provider but an entity authorized to contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>

<h2>Joint Base Cape Cod became OpenCape's first customer in 2012</h2>

<p>When OpenCape activated its network in 2012 following a <strong>$32 million NTIA federal grant</strong> and $5 million in Massachusetts state matching funds, the first customer was <strong>Joint Base Cape Cod</strong>—the 22,000-acre military installation housing:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>102nd Intelligence Wing</strong> (Massachusetts Air National Guard), which explicitly supports "two federal intelligence missions" and includes the 253rd Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group reporting to Air Force Space Command</li>
<li><strong>Cape Cod Space Force Station</strong> and its PAVE PAWS ballistic missile detection radar originally built by Raytheon</li>
<li>Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod</li>
<li>Massachusetts Army National Guard facilities at Camp Edwards</li>
</ul>

<p>This military anchor tenant relationship means defense communications traverse OpenCape's infrastructure from the network's inception.</p>

<h2>Raytheon built Cape Cod's most significant defense installation</h2>

<p>Raytheon's physical presence on Cape Cod centers on the <strong>PAVE PAWS (Phased Array Warning System)</strong> radar at Cape Cod Space Force Station in Bourne. In 1975, the U.S. Air Force awarded Raytheon the contract to construct this ballistic missile early warning system, which achieved operational capability in 1981. The original AN/FPS-115 radar was subsequently upgraded to the AN/FPS-123 and later the AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar.</p>

<p>The system detects submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles at ranges up to <strong>3,000 nautical miles</strong> and transmits data directly to Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon, and U.S. Strategic Command. While BAE Systems took over maintenance contracts in 2006, Raytheon designed, built, and upgraded the fundamental radar infrastructure that remains operational today.</p>

<strong>No Raytheon facilities</strong> were identified on Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket, nor in Cape Cod towns outside Joint Base Cape Cod.

<h2>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: the Navy contractor node</h2>

<p>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, one of OpenCape's founding institutional partners and early funders ($30,000 in seed capital), maintains substantial defense contracts. Documented Navy awards include:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>2020</td><td>$12.6 million</td><td>Communications, navigation, and unmanned vehicles for Arctic operations</td></tr>
<tr><td>2019</td><td>$8.4 million</td><td>"Project Sundance" (classified Navy project)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2018</td><td>$7.7 million</td><td>Office of Naval Research contract</td></tr>
<tr><td>2014</td><td>$35.5 million</td><td>Navy contract</td></tr>
</table>

<p>WHOI develops ocean battlespace sensors, unmanned undersea vehicles, and acoustic navigation systems for the U.S. Navy. A 2019 iDefense report documented Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting WHOI specifically to access "technology being developed for the U.S. Navy." The institution connects to OpenCape's fiber network, meaning defense research data traverses the regional telecommunications infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Raytheon's board features extensive defense and intelligence backgrounds</h2>

<p>While no Raytheon board members hold OpenCape positions, RTX Corporation's board demonstrates the defense contractor's deep ties to military and intelligence leadership:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Admiral James Winnefeld</strong> (Ret.): Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and NORAD Commander; currently chairs President Biden's Intelligence Advisory Board</li>
<li><strong>Robert O. Work</strong>: Former Deputy Secretary of Defense under both Obama and Trump; former Undersecretary of the Navy</li>
<li><strong>General Ellen Pawlikowski</strong> (Ret.): Former Commander of Air Force Materiel Command; former Deputy Director of the National Reconnaissance Office</li>
<li><strong>Leanne Caret</strong>: Former CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security</li>
</ul>

<p>Former board members included <strong>John Deutch</strong> (former CIA Director), <strong>Letitia Long</strong> (former Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), and <strong>Stephen Hadley</strong> (former National Security Advisor).</p>

<strong>Tracy Atkinson</strong>, a current RTX director and University of Massachusetts alumna with extensive Boston financial sector experience, represents the strongest Massachusetts connection on the board, though no Cape Cod ties were identified for any Raytheon director.

<h2>Federal telecommunications funding enabled the defense connectivity</h2>

<p>OpenCape's network construction was substantially funded through the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), a 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act initiative. The organization received:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$32,072,093</strong> from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration</li>
<li><strong>$5 million</strong> matching from the Massachusetts Broadband Institute</li>
<li><strong>~$3 million</strong> from county and private sources (including CapeNet)</li>
</ul>

<p>This federal investment built 550+ miles of fiber optic infrastructure connecting research institutions, municipal facilities, and military installations across Cape Cod and the Islands. The network connects to internet backbone infrastructure in Providence and Boston.</p>

<h2>Overlapping institutional interests rather than conspiracy</h2>

<p>The connections between OpenCape and defense contractors reflect the region's economic and institutional landscape rather than covert coordination. Cape Cod hosts significant military infrastructure—Joint Base Cape Cod spans 22,000 acres—and institutions like WHOI have conducted Navy-funded research since World War II. Federal broadband funding programs explicitly targeted "anchor institutions" including military facilities.</p>

<p>That said, the specific finding of a Raytheon employee on OpenCape's board, combined with OpenCape's registered defense contractor status and military customer base, demonstrates meaningful institutional overlap. The nonprofit telecommunications network that serves Cape Cod residents simultaneously serves as infrastructure for defense communications, intelligence operations, and classified Navy research.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The investigation identified <strong>one direct personal connection</strong>: OpenCape board member Jordan Keliinui's concurrent employment at Raytheon Technologies. No Raytheon board members or executives serve in OpenCape leadership. However, OpenCape's defense contractor registration, military founding leadership (Navy veteran co-founder Dan Gallagher), first customer relationship with Joint Base Cape Cod, and network connectivity to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's defense research establish substantive institutional ties between Cape Cod's civilian fiber infrastructure and the defense establishment that Raytheon serves.</p>
