<h1>Neptune Technology Group: Regulatory oversight structure reveals significant gaps</h1>

<p>The regulatory framework for Neptune smart meters operates through a fragmented system where <strong>no single federal agency holds comprehensive authority over biological safety</strong>, creating a structure focused primarily on spectrum interference and thermal effects rather than health outcomes. Neptune Technology Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies (NASDAQ: ROP), holds 45+ FCC equipment authorizations but faces no pre-market biological safety review—only verification that emissions fall within thermal-based limits established in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The FCC has primary jurisdiction but explicitly disclaims health authority, while agencies with health mandates (FDA, EPA) either don't actively regulate these devices or defer entirely to FCC standards. This arrangement means smart meters undergo less rigorous health review than medical devices, despite continuous proximity to residential environments.</p>

<h2>Corporate structure confirms private subsidiary status</h2>

<p>Neptune Technology Group operates as a <strong>private subsidiary of Roper Technologies, Inc.</strong>, a publicly-traded S&P 500 company headquartered in Sarasota, Florida. Roper acquired Neptune from private equity firm Investcorp in early 2004 for approximately <strong>$475 million</strong>, including subsidiaries DAP Technologies and DB Microware. The company has no independent SEC filings; all material financial information appears in Roper's consolidated 10-K and 10-Q reports under the "Technology Enabled Products" segment.</p>

<p>Neptune maintains headquarters at 1600 Alabama Highway 229 in Tallassee, Alabama, where it has operated since its founding in 1892—over 130 years of water meter manufacturing. The company employs approximately 500-760 people and generates estimated annual revenue of <strong>$217-218 million</strong>, serving more than 4,000 water utilities across North America.</p>

<p>Current leadership includes President and CEO Don Deemer, CFO Jason Constantino, and COO Kunwar Harricharran. In February 2025, Bloomberg reported Roper was exploring a potential sale of Neptune for up to <strong>$4 billion</strong>, though no completed transaction has been confirmed. Roper also acquired Muni-Link for $118 million in February 2025 and integrated it into Neptune's business unit.</p>

<h2>FCC certification relies entirely on third-party testing</h2>

<p>Neptune Technology Group (FCC Grantee Code <strong>P2S</strong>, FRN 0005079827) holds over 45 FCC equipment authorizations dating back to 2001. The company's smart meter and MIU devices are certified primarily under <strong>FCC Part 15 Subpart C, Section 15.247</strong> as spread spectrum transmitters operating in the 902-928 MHz ISM band. Key products include the R900 series (FCC IDs P2SR900M, P2SR900CE, P2SR900CEM), cellular MIU units (P2SGWMIU-1, P2SCMIU-1), and data collectors (P2SR450DC).</p>

<p>The certification process reveals a critical structural element: <strong>the FCC does not test devices directly</strong>. Instead, equipment authorization flows through:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Accredited testing laboratories</strong> (such as Advanced Compliance Solutions, US Tech) that measure RF output power, power spectral density, bandwidth, out-of-band emissions, and RF exposure compliance</li>
<li><strong>Telecommunication Certification Bodies (TCBs)</strong>—private organizations designated by FCC to review test data and issue grants of equipment authorization</li>
</ol>

<p>For Part 15.247 devices, testing must verify: maximum conducted output power ≤1 watt, power spectral density ≤8 dBm per 3 kHz band, minimum 6 dB bandwidth of 500 kHz, and ≥50 hopping channels for full power operation. Neptune's R900M devices operate at <strong>998 mW conducted power</strong> in the 911-919 MHz range, compliant with the 1W limit.</p>

<p>Required documentation includes test reports, RF exposure/MPE calculations, internal and external photos, user manuals, and antenna specifications. The testing verifies compliance with existing emission limits—there is no biological safety review, animal studies, or health effects evaluation beyond confirming emissions fall within Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) limits.</p>

<h2>The regulatory chain of custody contains structural gaps</h2>

<p>The oversight framework for AMI devices distributes authority across multiple agencies, but <strong>each agency's jurisdiction contains significant limitations</strong>:</p>

<strong>FCC (Primary Authority)</strong>: The FCC regulates spectrum allocation, RF interference, and equipment authorization under 47 CFR § 1.1307(b), § 1.1310, and § 2.1091-2.1093. The agency sets Maximum Permissible Exposure limits—approximately <strong>0.6 mW/cm²</strong> for general public exposure at 902 MHz. However, the FCC explicitly states: "The FCC's primary jurisdiction does not lie in the health and safety area, and it must rely on other agencies and organizations for guidance in these matters." The MPE limits are designed to prevent tissue heating, not biological effects at lower levels.

<strong>FDA (Limited Authority)</strong>: The FDA has authority over electronic products emitting radiation under 21 CFR Parts 1000-1040, derived from the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968. However, <strong>no performance standard exists for smart meters</strong>—they are not on FDA's regulated product list requiring pre-market reports. FDA focuses on products with established performance standards: microwave ovens, laser products, x-ray equipment. For smart meters, FDA defers to FCC exposure limits.

<strong>EPA (No Authority)</strong>: EPA explicitly states it "does not regulate non-ionizing radiation from cell phones, smart meters, or power lines." In the mid-1990s, EPA's authority to set RF exposure guidelines was effectively removed. The agency serves only an advisory role through the Federal RF Interagency Working Group.

<strong>OSHA (Advisory Only)</strong>: OSHA's nonionizing radiation standard at 29 CFR 1910.97 covers 10 MHz to 100 GHz with a 10 mW/cm² power density limit. However, this standard was <strong>ruled to be advisory, not mandatory</strong>—based on outdated 1971 standards. OSHA now references FCC/IEEE guidelines for enforcement under the general duty clause.

<strong>State Utility Commissions</strong>: State PUCs control deployment, procurement, and consumer protection but <strong>defer entirely to FCC on RF safety</strong>. They do not set independent health exposure limits. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled complainants must prove violations by "preponderance of evidence including expert testimony" on RF safety—placing the burden of demonstrating harm on consumers.

<h2>Public records show equipment authorizations but limited regulatory correspondence</h2>

<p>Research across FCC ECFS, Regulations.gov, and agency FOIA reading rooms found <strong>no publicly documented FOIA requests or responses specifically involving Neptune Technology Group</strong>. The company maintains FCC equipment authorizations in good standing with no documented enforcement actions, penalties, or regulatory correspondence issues.</p>

<p>GAO has issued relevant reports on the smart meter industry. <strong>GAO-11-117</strong> (January 2011) found smart meters lacked security features and identified six key cybersecurity challenges, recommending NIST finalize cybersecurity guidelines—a recommendation implemented in 2014. <strong>GAO-21-81</strong> (March 2021) found distribution systems increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, these reports focus on cybersecurity rather than RF health effects.</p>

<p>EPA's archived guidance simply states: "Smart meters use radiofrequency radiation (RF). The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sets exposure limits for RF radiation." No specific Neptune-EPA records exist. Similarly, FDA has no documented interactions with Neptune—as a water meter manufacturer, Neptune products fall outside FDA's active regulatory scope.</p>

<h2>Industry standards explicitly address only thermal effects</h2>

<p>The standards framework governing AMI device safety rests on <strong>IEEE C95.1-2019</strong>, which provides RF exposure limits based exclusively on preventing tissue heating. The standard's Annex B Executive Summary states: "A review of the extensive literature on RF Biological Effects reveals no adverse health effects that are not thermally related."</p>

<p>The threshold values underlying these limits derive from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whole-body averaged SAR threshold</strong>: 4 W/kg (based on behavioral disruption in laboratory animals)</li>
<li><strong>Localized exposure threshold</strong>: 100 W/kg (based on cataract formation in rabbits)</li>
</ul>

<p>Safety factors of 10x (occupational) and 50x (general public) are applied, resulting in limits of <strong>0.08 W/kg whole-body SAR</strong> for uncontrolled environments. Exposure is averaged over 30 minutes for whole-body and 6 minutes for localized exposure.</p>

<strong>ANSI C12.1-2024</strong> governs electricity metering accuracy and includes 44+ performance tests—but none address RF biological effects. The standard covers accuracy classes (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%), surge testing, and EMC emissions compliance. <strong>ANSI C12.10-2024</strong> addresses physical safety aspects (ratings, wiring, dimensions) but explicitly does not address RF exposure.

<strong>UL 2735</strong> provides electrical safety certification through temperature, insulation, surge, and fire safety testing—again with no RF biological effects requirements.

<p>The critical finding: <strong>no standard requires biological effects testing on humans or animals for smart meter compliance</strong>. The framework assumes that if RF emissions fall below IEEE C95.1/FCC limits, the device is safe based on prior research into thermal effects only.</p>

<h2>Standards committees include significant industry representation</h2>

<p>IEEE's International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES), which develops C95.1, comprises approximately <strong>209+ professionals from 27 countries</strong>, with 45% from outside the US. The committee claims "balanced representation from medical, scientific, engineering, industrial, government, and military communities," though the project originated in 1960 under Department of Navy and IEEE co-sponsorship.</p>

<p>ANSI C12 standards operate under joint secretariat of the <strong>National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)</strong> and NIST, with participating organizations including Itron, Inc., Radian Research, Inc., Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, and utility industry representatives.</p>

<p>For utility procurement, standard certifications required include: FCC Part 15 certification, ANSI C12.1/C12.20 accuracy compliance, and UL 2735 or equivalent electrical safety certification. <strong>Utilities do not typically require biological effects testing</strong> beyond FCC compliance—no independent RF health studies or non-thermal effects testing appears in procurement documentation.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The regulatory structure for Neptune Technology Group's smart meters reveals a framework designed primarily for spectrum management rather than health protection. The FCC certifies devices through third-party testing against thermal-only limits while explicitly disclaiming health jurisdiction. FDA has statutory authority over radiation-emitting products but has never established performance standards for smart meters. EPA has no regulatory role. OSHA's standard is unenforceable.</p>

<p>This creates a system where <strong>compliance verification substitutes for safety evaluation</strong>—if emissions fall within 1990s-era thermal limits, no further health review occurs. The standards themselves, developed by committees with significant industry participation, explicitly exclude non-thermal biological effects from their protective scope, considering such effects "insufficient to be considered a health hazard" despite ongoing scientific debate. For Neptune and all smart meter manufacturers, the path to market requires demonstrating RF output falls within prescribed limits, not demonstrating safety.</p>
