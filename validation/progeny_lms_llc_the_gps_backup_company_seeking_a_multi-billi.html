<h1>Progeny LMS LLC: The GPS backup company seeking a multi-billion dollar spectrum windfall</h1>

<strong>Progeny LMS LLC is not a mysterious high bidder but a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextNav Inc. (NASDAQ: NN)</strong>, a publicly traded Virginia-based positioning technology company. The entity holds FCC spectrum licenses in the 902-928 MHz band acquired at modest cost in 1999, and is now at the center of one of the most controversial spectrum proceedings in recent FCC history—a proposed "swap" that critics call "a transparent bid for a windfall" worth billions of dollars.

<p>The original premise that Progeny LMS was the "highest bidder by a significant margin" requires clarification: Progeny acquired its M-LMS licenses at <strong>FCC Auction 21 in 1999 for approximately $2.4 million</strong>—part of a total auction that raised just $5.3 million. The controversy today stems from NextNav's April 2024 petition to exchange these heavily encumbered, limited-use licenses for <strong>15 MHz of exclusive, full-power nationwide spectrum</strong> that would be worth billions at auction.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Corporate structure reveals NextNav as the ultimate parent</h2>

<strong>Progeny LMS, LLC</strong> is 100% owned by NextNav Inc., a Delaware corporation traded on NASDAQ under ticker NN. The corporate hierarchy includes several intermediate entities: Progeny LMS Holdings, Commlabs Holdings, and multiple NextNav subsidiary LLCs.

<strong>Key corporate details:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>State of incorporation</strong>: Likely Delaware (parent is Delaware-incorporated)</li>
<li><strong>Registered address</strong>: 20 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN (Progeny); Reston/McLean, VA (NextNav headquarters)</li>
<li><strong>SEC CIK</strong>: 1865631 (NextNav Inc.)</li>
<li><strong>Public company since</strong>: October 28, 2021 (SPAC merger with Spartacus Acquisition Corporation)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Current leadership includes</strong> CEO Mariam Sorond (appointed November 2023), Chairman Gary Parsons (founder of XM Satellite Radio), and co-founder Ganesh Pattabiraman (former CEO, now Senior Advisor). Parsons brings 45+ years in telecom innovation—he founded XM Satellite Radio, SkyTerra, TerreStar Networks, and MCImetro before leading NextNav.

<hr>

<h2>FCC auction history and the 25-year license saga</h2>

<p>Progeny LMS LLC obtained its spectrum through <strong>FCC Auction 21</strong> held February-March 1999, winning 228 Multilateration Location and Monitoring Service (M-LMS) licenses. The "LMS" designation refers to the FCC's "Location and Monitoring Service" spectrum classification, not a company acronym.</p>

<p>The company's license history is marked by repeated extensions and waivers:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Year</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>1999</td><td>Won licenses at Auction 21 (~$2.4M)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2000</td><td>FCC granted 228 licenses</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006</td><td>Three-year construction extension granted</td></tr>
<tr><td>2011-2012</td><td>Field testing requirements triggered; A Block licenses later terminated</td></tr>
<tr><td>2013</td><td>FCC unanimously authorized commercial operations</td></tr>
<tr><td>2017</td><td>A Block licenses terminated; B/C Block extensions granted</td></tr>
<tr><td>2020</td><td>Additional construction waiver granted</td></tr>
<tr><td>2023</td><td>Waiver allowing tall building coverage instead of population metric</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Current license conditions require Progeny to "continue to provide location accuracy services on all B and C Block licenses for at least a five (5) year period ending <strong>April 3, 2028</strong>."</p>

<hr>

<h2>Funding trail leads to major venture capital and Fortress Investment</h2>

<p>NextNav has raised <strong>$284 million across 11 funding rounds</strong> from prominent institutional investors. The money behind the spectrum bids and business development comes from:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Enterprise Associates (NEA)</strong> - Lead investor in $70M Series D (2014)</li>
<li><strong>Oak Investment Partners</strong> - Co-lead Series D</li>
<li><strong>Fortress Investment Group</strong> - Led $120M debt and equity round (2020)</li>
<li><strong>Goldman Sachs Investment Partners</strong></li>
<li><strong>Columbia Capital</strong> (Alexandria, VA-based)</li>
<li><strong>Telcom Ventures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Future Fund</strong> (Australian sovereign wealth)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>March 2025 financing of $190 million</strong> (post-IPO) represents the most recent capital raise. Despite this investment, NextNav has been "a complete failure" commercially according to critical financial analysts—losing $100 million annually on just <strong>$6 million in revenue</strong> four years after going public, with accumulated losses of <strong>$920 million</strong> since 2007.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The 2024 spectrum petition: Critics call it "land grab" for billions</h2>

<p>The real story is NextNav's <strong>April 16, 2024 petition for rulemaking</strong> (FCC WT Docket No. 24-240) proposing to:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reconfigure the 902-928 MHz band</strong> into a 5 MHz uplink (902-907 MHz) paired with 10 MHz downlink (918-928 MHz)</li>
<li><strong>"Swap" its existing M-LMS licenses</strong> for a single, nationwide 15-megahertz flexible use license</li>
<li><strong>Remove the requirement</strong> to not cause interference to Part 15 devices</li>
<li><strong>Relocate all other incumbents</strong> to the remaining 907-918 MHz portion</li>
</ol>

<strong>Critics estimate NextNav's existing licenses are worth far less than the flexible-use spectrum they seek.</strong> Public Knowledge and Open Technology Institute noted that NextNav "openly admits" its PNT proposal requires only <strong>5% of the 15 MHz requested</strong>—calling it "a transparent bid for a windfall." The petition would effectively grant NextNav spectrum that, if auctioned, would be worth <strong>billions of dollars</strong>.

<p>The opposition has been overwhelming—<strong>nearly 2,000 documents filed against the petition</strong>, including from:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Chamber of Commerce coalition</li>
<li>Boeing, Texas Instruments, Motorola Solutions</li>
<li>RAIN Alliance (RFID industry)</li>
<li>Z-Wave Alliance, Wi-Fi Alliance, LoRa Alliance</li>
<li>Security Industry Association</li>
<li>Airlines for America</li>
<li>Association of American Railroads</li>
<li>Amateur radio operators (ARRL)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Smart meter and utility connections are adversarial, not partnerships</h2>

<p>Contrary to potential assumptions, Progeny LMS has <strong>no partnership with smart meter manufacturers</strong>. The relationship is adversarial:</p>

<strong>Itron, Landis+Gyr, and utility companies</strong> opposed Progeny's FCC waivers, citing interference concerns with their 902-928 MHz smart grid equipment. Joint field testing in 2012 produced disputed results—Progeny claimed minimal interference while industry users reported <strong>40-50% throughput degradation</strong>.

<p>The <strong>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC)</strong> passed a resolution in 2013 requesting the FCC to require additional testing before authorizing operations. The 902-928 MHz band supports hundreds of millions of Part 15 unlicensed devices including smart meters, RFID systems, industrial IoT sensors, baby monitors, and electronic toll collection.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Government connections: Evaluated but not contracted</h2>

<strong>Progeny LMS LLC and NextNav have no direct defense contracts</strong>, facility clearances, or intelligence community ties. The company is <strong>completely unrelated to Progeny Systems Corporation</strong>—a defense contractor owned by General Dynamics Mission Systems specializing in submarine systems and naval weapons.

<p>However, government agencies have evaluated NextNav's technology:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Transportation (2021)</strong>: Named TerraPoiNT "the best and only performing solution across all PNT categories" in a study mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act</li>
<li><strong>DHS Science & Technology Directorate (2021)</strong>: Tested timing redundancy during simulated GPS outages; validated TerraPoiNT delivered timing accuracy better than 50 nanoseconds during 72-hour GPS blackout</li>
<li><strong>DOT contract (2024)</strong>: $1.9 million awarded for testing 3D PNT technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>NextNav positions itself for national security applications as a GPS backup for critical infrastructure, but is <strong>not a government contractor</strong>—the company explicitly states its approach requires "no taxpayer dollars."</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lobbying activities and regulatory engagement</h2>

<strong>Confirmed lobbying expenditures</strong> for NextNav Inc.:
<ul>
<li>2022: $580,000</li>
<li>2024 (H1): $370,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Progeny LMS LLC is listed in the LegiStorm lobbying database. The company employs Jones Day as FCC counsel and has a dedicated Vice President of Government Affairs (Ed Mortimer). NextNav actively engages with FCC, NTIA, and Congress on spectrum policy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Patents and intellectual property portfolio</h2>

<p>NextNav holds <strong>over 100 U.S. patents</strong> covering its Pinnacle (vertical location) and TerraPoiNT (wide-area positioning) technologies. Progeny LMS, LLC is listed as a security assignor on many filings.</p>

<strong>Key patents include</strong>:
<ul>
<li>US 8130141: Wide Area Positioning System</li>
<li>US 9913273: LTE-Based Wireless Communication System for M-LMS Band</li>
<li>US 10386448: Systems for Selecting Atmospheric Data for Computing Altitude</li>
<li>US 11047991: Coding in a Positioning System</li>
</ul>

<p>Security interests have been held by <strong>Fortress Credit Corp.</strong> (2019-2021) and currently by <strong>GLAS Trust Company LLC</strong> (2025).</p>

<strong>No litigation</strong> has been filed by or against Progeny LMS LLC according to RPX Insight records.

<hr>

<h2>The 2024 license acquisition from Telesaurus</h2>

<p>In <strong>March 2024</strong>, NextNav/Progeny LMS acquired additional M-LMS licenses from <strong>Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC</strong> and <strong>Skybridge Spectrum Foundation</strong> (controlled by Warren Havens, who was under court-ordered receivership) for up to <strong>$50 million</strong> in cash and stock.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial payment: $2.5 million cash</li>
<li>Shares issued at closing (September 2025): 1,194,820 shares worth ~$20 million to Northlake Crystal, LLC</li>
<li>Potential additional consideration: $20 million contingent on FCC granting spectrum flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>This acquisition consolidated virtually all M-LMS spectrum under NextNav control, strengthening their petition for band reconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: A struggling company seeking regulatory windfall</h2>

<p>Progeny LMS LLC is not a mysterious entity but a subsidiary of a publicly traded company with a <strong>well-documented 25-year regulatory history</strong>. The company acquired its spectrum licenses legitimately at FCC auction, but has failed to build a profitable business—accumulating nearly <strong>$1 billion in losses</strong> while generating minimal revenue.</p>

<p>The current controversy centers on NextNav's attempt to transform heavily encumbered, limited-use spectrum into valuable flexible-use licenses through regulatory action rather than auction. Critics argue this constitutes an "anti-competitive" subsidy that only Congress has authority to grant. The FCC has opened a Notice of Inquiry (WT Docket No. 25-110) on complementary PNT technologies but has not signaled when it will act on NextNav's petition.</p>

<strong>The ultimate question is whether the FCC will grant a private company billions of dollars in spectrum value</strong> by administrative fiat—or require NextNav to compete for flexible-use spectrum through normal auction processes like everyone else.
