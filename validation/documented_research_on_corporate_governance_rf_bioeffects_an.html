<h1>Documented Research on Corporate Governance, RF Bioeffects, and Public Health Policy</h1>

<p>This report presents publicly documented findings across eight interconnected research areas spanning telecommunications, defense, pharmaceutical sectors, regulatory history, and government-funded health research. Key findings include: the 21st Century Cures Act attracted <strong>$192+ million</strong> in pharmaceutical and device industry lobbying; US government RF bioeffects research was systematically defunded after 1996 despite the NTP's <strong>$30 million study</strong> finding "clear evidence" of carcinogenicity in 2018; Operation Warp Speed leadership had significant pharmaceutical industry ties; and FCC Part 15.247 rules governing smart meters were adopted <strong>without biological safety provisions</strong> 11 years before RF exposure guidelines existed. Moderna received <strong>$2.48 billion</strong> in government funding through BARDA/OWS, while critical gaps remain in epidemiological research on smart meter health effects and RF-lipid nanoparticle interactions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Corporate governance connections span defense and pharmaceutical sectors</h2>

<p>Research into SEC filings and corporate disclosures reveals documented cross-sector board connections, though direct AMI/smart meter company connections to defense and pharmaceutical sectors are limited. The most significant documented defense-pharmaceutical connection is <strong>Laura J. Schumacher</strong>, who simultaneously served on the General Dynamics board (since 2014, Lead Director since 2023) while serving as Vice Chairman of External Affairs and Chief Legal Counsel at <strong>AbbVie Inc.</strong> (2018-2022) and previously as EVP General Counsel of Abbott Laboratories (2007-2012). Additionally, <strong>Cecil D. Haney</strong> serves as director of both General Dynamics and Tenet Healthcare Corporation.</p>

<p>The smart meter/AMI sector shows primarily utility-industry backgrounds among leadership. At Itron (NASDAQ: ITRI), the board includes executives from Southern California Edison and semiconductor companies. Landis+Gyr board member <strong>Dave Geary</strong> brings telecom experience from Nokia Networks and Alcatel-Lucent. Silver Spring Networks (acquired by Itron for <strong>$830 million</strong> in 2018) included former Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz and former Nokia executive Rick Simonson on its board.</p>

<p>The FCC demonstrates well-documented revolving door patterns with telecommunications industry. Former Commissioners who moved to industry positions include <strong>Meredith Attwell Baker</strong> (to NBCUniversal within 4 months of approving Comcast/NBC merger), <strong>Tom Wheeler</strong> (former CTIA head to FCC Chairman), <strong>Michael Powell</strong> (to NCTA President/CEO), and <strong>Ajit Pai</strong> (former Verizon lawyer to FCC Chairman to Searchlight Capital). Over 100 FCC personnel have moved to private sector telecom positions according to documented disclosures.</p>

<p>During COVID-19 vaccine development, the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium created overlap between defense contractors and pharmaceutical manufacturers, with members including Pfizer, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson (vaccine manufacturers) alongside General Dynamics and Booz Allen Hamilton (defense contractors). Pfizer and Moderna became <strong>top-10 Pentagon contractors</strong> in FY2021 due to vaccine procurement contracts.</p>

<strong>Documented gap</strong>: No evidence found of direct board connections between AMI/smart meter company executives and defense contractors or pharmaceutical companies.

<hr>

<h2>The 21st Century Cures Act attracted unprecedented industry lobbying</h2>

<p>The 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 34, signed December 13, 2016) was the second-most lobbied healthcare bill since 2011, with <strong>1,455+ registered lobbyists</strong> and <strong>400+ organizations</strong> participating. Total lobbying disclosures citing the legislation approached <strong>$500 million</strong> between 2015 and Q2 2016.</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical industry lobbying was substantial. PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) spent <strong>$24.7 million</strong> lobbying on the bill, while AbbVie spent <strong>$7.7 million</strong>. Combined pharmaceutical, device, and biotech company lobbying totaled <strong>$192+ million</strong>. The medical device industry, through AdvaMed (Advanced Medical Technology Association), spent <strong>$2.36 million</strong> in 2014 alone. Notably, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health and AdvaMed <strong>"worked together on proposed language for most of the device provisions"</strong> according to documented agency communications.</p>

<p>Primary sponsor Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) received <strong>$1.3+ million</strong> from healthcare PACs during bill development, <strong>$253,615</strong> from pharmaceutical companies in the 2012 cycle, and <strong>$118,300+</strong> from the medical device industry since 2013. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) received <strong>$1.1 million</strong> career contributions from pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Key provisions supported by pharmaceutical industry lobbying included "Real World Evidence" for drug approval (Section 3022), allowing FDA to accept observational studies instead of full clinical trials; data summaries for new drug indications rather than complete trial data; expanded off-label marketing to insurers; and expedited approval pathways for breakthrough therapies. The medical device industry secured priority review for breakthrough devices (Section 2201), third-party quality system assessment, and the <strong>"least burdensome means"</strong> requirement providing legal tools to challenge FDA requests.</p>

<p>The Project on Government Oversight documented that <strong>39 of 42 patient advocacy groups</strong> participating in FDA discussions received pharmaceutical company funding, with 15 having drug or biotech representatives on their governing boards. Critics included Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called the bill <strong>"hijacked"</strong> by pharmaceutical interests, and Public Citizen, which termed FDA-AdvaMed collaboration <strong>"alarming"</strong> and <strong>"collusion."</strong> The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support: 392-26 in the House, 94-5 in the Senate.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Government RF bioeffects research was systematically defunded after 1996</h2>

<p>The 1994 USAF Rome Laboratory report by Scott M. Bolen (DTIC document ADA282886) documented established non-thermal RF biological effects, noting <strong>"nonthermal disruptions have been observed to occur at power densities that are much lower than are necessary to induce thermal effects"</strong> and that Soviet researchers had attributed CNS and cardiovascular alterations to non-thermal RF/MW radiation. The report recommended that ANSI standards may be insufficient for protecting against non-thermal effects.</p>

<p>However, 1996 marked a critical turning point. Senate Report 104-140 explicitly <strong>defunded EPA's work on EMF/RF research</strong> with language stating "EPA should not engage in EMF activities." The EPA had been developing RF radiation guidelines considering both thermal and non-thermal effects, and was preparing Phase 2 research on "modulated and nonthermal exposures" when this work was terminated. EPA staff on EMF health research dropped from 30+ to essentially one person (Norbert Hankin). The 1996 Telecommunications Act simultaneously transferred regulatory authority to the FCC, a non-health agency.</p>

<p>That same year, the FCC adopted its current RF exposure guidelines based on ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992 and NCRP Report 86 (1986), establishing limits based <strong>only on thermal (heating) effects</strong> without consideration of non-thermal biological effects, chronic exposures, or children's vulnerability. <strong>These limits remain unchanged as of January 2026.</strong></p>

<p>The National Toxicology Program conducted the most comprehensive US government RF bioeffects study at a cost of <strong>$30 million</strong>, running from approximately 2005-2016 with final reports in November 2018. Key findings included <strong>"clear evidence"</strong> of heart tumors (malignant schwannomas) in male rats, <strong>"some evidence"</strong> of brain tumors (gliomas), and DNA damage in brains of exposed rats and mice. Despite these findings, NIEHS terminated all follow-up research in 2024, stating <strong>"No further work with this RFR exposure system will be conducted and NIEHS has no further plans to conduct additional RFR exposure studies at this time."</strong></p>

<p>Air Force Research Laboratory continues RF bioeffects research, primarily for military applications. A 2022 AFRL study found 900 MHz RF exposure causes <strong>immediate DNA methylation changes</strong> in human keratinocytes at low-level exposure (SAR <10 mW/kg), challenging the thermal-only paradigm. DARPA's RadioBio program (approximately $3.3 million to Scripps Institution of Oceanography) investigates whether biological organisms use RF for signaling.</p>

<p>A 2012 GAO report (GAO-12-771) found FCC RF exposure limits <strong>"may not reflect the latest research"</strong> and recommended formal reassessment. The FCC closed this inquiry in 2019 without action. In 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court (Environmental Health Trust v. FCC) ruled the FCC's decision to maintain 1996 guidelines was <strong>"arbitrary and capricious,"</strong> ordering the agency to address impacts on children, long-term exposure, and non-cancer health effects. The FCC has not fully complied with this court order as of 2026.</p>

<p>A 2020 EPA letter confirmed the agency <strong>"does not have a funded mandate for radiofrequency matters,"</strong> has no dedicated RF subject matter expert, and has not conducted a research review since 1984.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Operation Warp Speed leadership had extensive pharmaceutical industry ties</h2>

<p>Operation Warp Speed (OWS), announced May 15, 2020, combined HHS and DOD resources with initial funding of approximately <strong>$10 billion</strong> from the CARES Act, expanding to <strong>$18 billion</strong> by October 2020. The organizational structure documented in GAO reports included approximately <strong>90 leaders: ~60 military officials</strong> (including at least 4 generals) and <strong>~29 civilian officials</strong> from HHS subagencies.</p>

<p>Chief Advisor <strong>Dr. Moncef Slaoui</strong> served from May 2020 to January 2021. His documented background included 30 years at GlaxoSmithKline (Chairman of Global R&D, Chairman of Global Vaccines, overseeing development of 5 major vaccines), board member at <strong>Moderna</strong> (resigned upon appointment), board member at Lonza, and partner at Medicxi venture capital firm. Critically, Slaoui was hired as a <strong>contractor through Advanced Decision Vectors LLC</strong> rather than as a federal employee, exempting him from federal conflict of interest codes (18 USC 208), personal financial disclosure requirements, and standard ethics requirements.</p>

<p>Slaoui retained approximately <strong>$10 million in GSK stock</strong> (describing it as "my retirement"). His Moderna stock value increased <strong>$2.4 million</strong> shortly after appointment. Public Citizen and Lower Drug Prices Now filed ethics complaints arguing Slaoui should be classified as a "special government employee" subject to conflict of interest rules. The HHS Inspector General dismissed the complaint in July 2020.</p>

<p>Chief Operating Officer <strong>General Gustave F. Perna</strong> (four-star, U.S. Army) previously served as Commanding General of U.S. Army Materiel Command, managing 190,000+ personnel. Vaccine Development Lead <strong>Dr. Matthew Hepburn</strong> had 23 years of active duty as an Army infectious disease physician, served as Program Manager at DARPA (2013-2019), and as Director of Medical Preparedness on the White House National Security Staff during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>The FDA maintained a <strong>"bright line"</strong> separating most officials from formal OWS participation over conflicts with its regulatory mission. Dr. Janet Woodcock took temporary leave from FDA to lead therapeutics.</p>

<p>Vaccine contract awards via BARDA and DOD totaled billions: Moderna received up to <strong>$483 million</strong> initially plus additional funding; Johnson & Johnson received <strong>~$1.5 billion</strong>; AstraZeneca received <strong>up to $1.2 billion</strong>; Sanofi/GSK received <strong>up to $2.1 billion</strong>; Novavax received <strong>$1.6 billion</strong>; and Pfizer received a <strong>$1.95 billion</strong> advance purchase agreement (but no R&D funding). Approximately <strong>$8 billion</strong> was obligated through Other Transaction Authority, allowing flexible terms without full Federal Acquisition Regulation compliance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>FCC Part 15.247 rules were adopted without biological safety provisions</h2>

<p>The FCC's Part 15.247 rules governing spread spectrum systems in the 902-928 MHz ISM band were established through GEN Docket No. 81-413, with the First Report and Order adopted May 9, 1985 (50 FR 25234). <strong>The original rulemaking did NOT include biological safety or RF exposure considerations.</strong> The FCC did not have comprehensive RF exposure requirements until <strong>11 years later in 1996</strong> (FCC 96-326, ET Docket 93-62).</p>

<p>The original 1985 proceeding focused on interference management and spectrum sharing. Comments from Docket 81-413 predate the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System and have been transferred to the National Archives—some boxes reportedly could not be located as of a 2010 search attempt. The rules were developed by FCC staff including Michael Marcus and were opposed by mainstream equipment manufacturers at the time.</p>

<p>Smart meter/AMI applications emerged <strong>after</strong> the original rules, with widespread deployment beginning in the 2000s. The utility industry therefore did not shape the original 1985 rules. Current smart meter technical specifications under Part 15.247 include maximum power output of <strong>1 watt</strong> in the 902 MHz band, frequency hopping spread spectrum operation, and FCC certification requirements.</p>

<p>RF safety requirements were applied retroactively to Part 15.247 devices only after the 1996 FCC 96-326 rulemaking. When adopting 1996 guidelines, the FCC consulted EPA, FDA, OSHA, and NIOSH—but no public health agencies were consulted during the original 1985 rulemaking. Current standards reference NCRP Report No. 86 (1986), ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, and OET Bulletin 65.</p>

<p>Maximum permissible exposure at 915 MHz is approximately <strong>0.6 mW/cm²</strong> for general population. Industry studies indicate smart meter RF exposure is typically less than <strong>1% of FCC limits</strong> at 8 inches from the meter, with duty cycles typically 0.1% or less due to intermittent transmission.</p>

<strong>Documented gaps</strong>: The original 1985 rules were adopted without RF safety provisions; cumulative exposure from mesh networks was not specifically addressed; and no evaluation of smart meter applications specifically occurred since they didn't exist when rules were written.

<hr>

<h2>Academic literature documents RF membrane effects but gaps exist for mRNA-LNPs</h2>

<p>Peer-reviewed research documents non-thermal RF effects on cell membranes through several mechanisms. <strong>Wust et al. (2020, Scientific Reports)</strong> demonstrated that RF hyperthermia at 13.56 MHz reduced cancer cell proliferation <strong>twice as much</strong> as water bath heating at the same temperature, proposing that ion channels act as "half-wave rectifiers" converting sinusoidal RF into DC voltage, inducing ion fluxes causing cellular disequilibrium.</p>

<p>Membrane fluidity changes under RF exposure are documented. <strong>Phelan et al. (1992, Bioelectromagnetics)</strong> found 2.45 GHz pulsed microwaves at 0.2 W/kg shifted membrane ordering from fluid-like to more solid state in melanotic cells, mediated by oxygen radicals. <strong>Campisi et al. (1997)</strong> documented decreased membrane fluidity in human lymphoid cells after 72-hour exposure to 50 Hz fields.</p>

<p>Research on membrane permeability includes <strong>Nguyen et al. (2015-2016, Scientific Reports/PLOS ONE)</strong>, showing 18 GHz EMF induced cell permeabilization in bacteria and yeast while cells remained <strong>~94% viable</strong> through a "quasi-endocytosis" process. <strong>Ahortor et al.</strong> demonstrated strong disruption of cell membrane integrity at 2.45 GHz (132 W/kg) through nucleic acid release—notably, corresponding conventional heating did NOT produce significant leakage, suggesting a non-thermal mechanism.</p>

<p>RF-triggered drug release from liposomes is established technology. <strong>US Patent 5,190,761 (Liburdy, 1993)</strong> documents non-thermal EMF-triggered drug release from liposomes at 26-2450 MHz. <strong>Chen et al. (2010)</strong> showed RF EMF enhanced vesicular endocytosis of cationic solid lipid nanoparticles, increasing drug permeability approximately <strong>22-fold</strong> with combined CSLN encapsulation and EMF exposure.</p>

<strong>Critical research gap</strong>: No published peer-reviewed studies directly examine RF or electromagnetic field effects on mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine stability. Available LNP stability research (including Schoenmaker et al. 2021, International Journal of Pharmaceutics) addresses temperature, pH, and lipid oxidation but makes no mention of electromagnetic field effects. This represents a significant gap given widespread interest in both mRNA vaccine technology and electromagnetic field bioeffects.

<hr>

<h2>Smart meter health research relies on mobile phone studies as proxy</h2>

<p>Government health agency assessments consistently conclude smart meter RF emissions are well below established safety limits, but <strong>no epidemiological studies specific to smart meter health outcomes exist</strong>. The California Council on Science and Technology (CCST, April 2011) found exposure levels "well below the thresholds" for thermal effects and that "no standards are needed at this time" for non-thermal effects, while recommending additional research.</p>

<p>Vermont Department of Health (February 2012) conducted field measurements at Green Mountain Power smart meters finding readings of <strong>50-140 µW/cm²</strong> at direct contact versus the FCC limit of <strong>610 µW/cm²</strong>, with readings at or near background levels at 3 feet. The report explicitly stated: <strong>"There are not yet any research studies on health effects using smart meters as the source."</strong></p>

<p>UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) conducted systematic smart meter assessments (2017-2023), finding maximum whole-body SAR of 1.87 mW/kg in child models—well below ICNIRP limits—and maximum in-home exposure at <strong><0.003%</strong> of ICNIRP reference levels. Australian ARPANSA found smart meter RF energy "similar to car remote unlocking fob and much less than GSM SMS transmission."</p>

<p>EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute), funded by electric utilities, conducted primary characterization studies including Technical Report 1021126 (December 2010) for Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. A 2020 peer-reviewed publication (Aerts et al., Environmental Research) funded by EPRI found worst-case time-averaged exposure at 0.3m was <strong>9.43%</strong> of ICNIRP reference levels.</p>

<p>Self-reported symptom research includes <strong>Lamech (2014, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine)</strong>, documenting 142 people reporting symptoms including insomnia, headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, and cognitive disturbances after smart meter installation in Victoria, Australia—notably, the "vast majority" did not report prior EHS history. However, this was a case series without control group or blinding.</p>

<p>Systematic reviews of electromagnetic hypersensitivity provocation studies (<strong>Rubin et al. 2005, 2010</strong>) analyzing 46 experiments with 1,175 EHS volunteers found no evidence that EMF exposure triggers symptoms under double-blind conditions. <strong>Huss et al. (2016)</strong> conducted personalized home testing with mobile exposure units and found <strong>"No participant was able to correctly identify when they were being exposed better than chance."</strong></p>

<strong>Documented gaps</strong>: No epidemiological studies specific to smart meters; no longitudinal health outcome tracking; all health assessments rely on mobile phone research as proxy; limited research on pulsed versus continuous wave exposure differences, cumulative exposure from multiple sources, and vulnerable populations.

<hr>

<h2>Moderna and BioNTech received substantial early government funding</h2>

<strong>Moderna</strong> was founded in 2010 by Flagship Pioneering (venture capital). By 2012, the company had raised <strong>$40 million</strong>; by its December 2018 IPO (raising <strong>$604 million</strong>, the largest biotech IPO at the time), total funding exceeded <strong>$2.6 billion</strong>.

<p>Government funding was substantial. <strong>DARPA</strong> provided approximately <strong>$25 million</strong> (Agreement No. W911NF-13-1-0417) starting in 2013 through the ADEPT program for mRNA research against infectious diseases including Chikungunya. <strong>BARDA</strong> awarded up to <strong>$125.8 million</strong> (Agreement No. HHSO100201600029C) in September 2016 for Zika vaccine development. NIH/NIAID signed a Cooperative R&D Agreement in 2015; critically, NIH scientists (Barney Graham, Kizzmekia Corbett, John Mascola) developed the stabilized prefusion spike protein technology using the "2P mutation"—a critical component of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>During COVID-19, Moderna received <strong>$483 million</strong> (April 2020), <strong>$472 million</strong> for Phase 3 trials (July 2020), and <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> for manufacturing and delivery (August 2020), totaling approximately <strong>$2.48 billion</strong> through BARDA/OWS. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided <strong>$20 million</strong> in January 2016 for HIV mRNA research with potential commitment up to $100 million.</p>

<strong>BioNTech</strong> was founded in 2008 with <strong>€136.5-180 million</strong> seed funding from the Strüngmann family (German billionaire twins who sold Hexal to Novartis for $6.7 billion in 2005) and MIG Capital. The company raised <strong>$270 million</strong> in Series A (January 2018) and <strong>$325 million</strong> in Series B (July 2019), then <strong>$150 million</strong> in its October 2019 IPO. The Strüngmann family held <strong>50.2%</strong> ownership at IPO.

<p>The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invested <strong>$55 million</strong> (September 2019, pre-IPO) for infectious disease programs, with additional commitments up to $100 million. The European Investment Bank provided <strong>€50 million</strong> (December 2019) and <strong>€100 million</strong> (June 2020). German BMBF provided up to <strong>€375 million</strong> (~$445 million) in September 2020 for COVID-19 vaccine development.</p>

<p>The Pfizer partnership (April 2020) included <strong>$185 million</strong> upfront ($72 million cash, $113 million equity) with up to <strong>$563 million</strong> in milestone payments. <strong>Notably, Pfizer did NOT receive US government funding for vaccine development</strong>—joining Operation Warp Speed only with a <strong>$1.95 billion</strong> advance purchase agreement for 100 million doses, paid upon FDA authorization.</p>

<p>BMJ analysis of pre-pandemic public investment found <strong>$337 million</strong> in total: NIH <strong>$116 million</strong> (35%), BARDA <strong>$148 million</strong> (44%), Department of Defense <strong>$72 million</strong> (21%). Key grant identifiers include DARPA Agreement W911NF-13-1-0417 and BARDA Agreement HHSO100201600029C.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This research documents significant interconnections between government policy, industry lobbying, and public health research across telecommunications, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors. Key patterns emerge: the systematic defunding of civilian RF health research after 1996 despite ongoing military research; the adoption of RF exposure rules without biological safety provisions; unprecedented pharmaceutical industry influence on FDA approval pathways through the 21st Century Cures Act; and substantial government investment in mRNA technology development predating the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Critical gaps in publicly available information include: limited documentation of cross-sector board memberships between AMI companies and defense/pharma; original FCC rulemaking comments potentially lost at National Archives; absence of epidemiological studies specific to smart meter exposure; no published research on RF effects on mRNA-LNP stability; and incomplete FCC compliance with 2021 court order on RF exposure guidelines. These gaps represent areas where further research or FOIA requests might yield additional documentation.</p>
